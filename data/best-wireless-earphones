Whether you have a phone with no audio jack or prefer the freedom of going wireless, finding the best in-ear wireless headphones comes down to what matters most to you. If you're looking for earphones to use at the office, noise isolation and battery life might be your top priorities; if you need in-ears for the gym, you'll probably care more about fit and durability. There are specialized models to fit virtually every need; some are even versatile enough to keep up whether you're running a marathon or sitting on the bus. With so many different models to choose from, where do you start?We've bought and tested over 240 pairs of wireless earbuds and in-ear headphones, and below, you'll find our recommendations for the best wireless earbuds to buy. If you're curious about wireless headphones, consider our recommendations for the best Bluetooth headphones. You'll also want to check our picks for the best wireless Bluetooth earbuds under $50 and $100 if you have a specific budget.The best wireless Bluetooth earbuds we've tested are the Sony WF-1000XM5 Truly Wireless. The next generation of the Sony WF-1000XM4 Truly Wireless boast an improved sound and a new design. They have a smaller and more rounded shape, along with memory foam ear tips that help passively block out background noise. There's also an ANC feature on hand, though you may not notice much difference with it on or off because these ear tips do such a good job passively isolating you from sounds. Either way, it's a great way to focus on your tunes within noisy environments.These ear tips won't be comfortable for everyone, so you can always check out the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II Truly Wireless if you want a more cozy fit. These earbuds don't sit as deep in your ear, which is nice. However, they don't have as many sound enhancement features as the Sony headphones, and their default sound isn't as balanced and neutral, which isn't ideal for everyone. Both come with a graphic EQ to switch up their sound, but only the Sony has 360 Reality Audio, which creates a unique sound profile based on the shape of your ear. We plan to test the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Truly Wireless as well, and we'll be sure to update this article once we do.See our reviewThe Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) Truly Wireless are, as the name states, the next generation of Apple AirPods Pro Truly Wireless. These earbuds have the same premium build and comfortable design as their predecessor. Plus, they come with lots of the same Apple-exclusive features, like an H2 chip for easy pairing with iOS devices as well as virtual surround sound via Apple Music. While their sound customization options are lacking in comparison with the Sony WF-1000XM5 Truly Wireless, this might not be an issue thanks to their well-balanced sound right out of the box.Their active noise cancelling (ANC) feature does a great job of blocking noise in the bass and mid-range. There's a 'Transparency' mode for when you want to hear your surroundings, but otherwise, you can't adjust the ANC. With ANC on, these earbuds last six hours off a single charge, and their case holds four extra charges, so you can always top it up. If you're looking for premium earbuds with a longer-lasting battery, the Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 last almost nine hours on a single charge. However, they aren't as comfortable, and their ANC doesn't perform quite as well.See our reviewThe Google Pixel Buds Pro Truly Wireless are the best Bluetooth earbuds in the mid-range. These earbuds don't have the same premium feel as the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) Truly Wireless, but they're packed with plenty of features you might not expect, considering their lower price. Their ANC has a similarly excellent performance, so it can help reduce noise like rumbling engines or background conversations when you're on the go. They have a continuous battery life of about eight hours and come with a portable charging case that stores extra charges. They even support multi-device pairing, meaning you can simultaneously stay connected with your phone and computer.While they have a comfortable fit for most people, they can pop out of your ears over time. This can affect how the earbuds deliver bass, so getting a good fit is important to ensure consistent sound delivery. If you want earbuds with a more comfortable fit overall, the Sony LinkBuds S Truly Wireless are another great mid-range option. They have a more stable fit but a weaker ANC performance, though this may be better suited for runs where you want to stay aware of your surroundings.See our reviewThe Anker Soundcore Space A40 Truly Wireless are the best Bluetooth in-ear headphones in the lower mid-range. They're a relatively affordable option with plenty of features like ANC and app support. Their noise isolation performance rivals the Google Pixel Buds Pro Truly Wireless', so they can help reduce noise during your commute or at the office. You can also choose different modes to suit different situations, including an adaptive setting to adjust automatically to the amount of noise in your environment. With ANC on, they last about eight hours of continuous use, and their case stores four extra charges. Like the previous pick, they support multi-device pairing, too.They have a warm default sound profile, with cozy-sounding vocals and lead instruments. The companion app includes a graphic EQ and presets if you prefer a different sound, but unlike the Google earbuds, they don't come with any virtual surround sound features. They aren't the best option for workouts since they don't have stability fins or a very stable fit and may slip out of place if you move your head around a lot. The Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC Truly Wireless are a good alternative if you want similarly-performing buds with a slightly different shape. Compared to the Space A40's rounded look, the Liberty 4 have a more traditional stem design that some users may find preferable. The Liberty 4 also bring a touch more bass, though this muddies their reproduction of vocals and instruments a bit.See our reviewThe JBL Vibe Beam True Wireless are the best wireless earbuds in the budget range that we've tested. These earbuds are reasonably comfortable and have a durable build quality. Paired with a battery life of just over eight hours, they'll last the workday without needing a top-up, and their IP54 rating against dust and water exposure makes them well-suited for weekends on the go. Unlike the Anker Soundcore Space A40 Truly Wireless, they don't have an ANC system and can't cut out the deep rumble from bus and plane engines, though they do a good job at isolating you from office-type noise, like background chit-chat or whiny AC units.They have a fairly neutral default sound profile. There's enough thumpy bass to please fans of EDM and hip-hop, but an overemphasized treble range makes instruments and vocals sound harsh and sibilants piercing. Fortunately, you can change the mix using their companion app's parametric EQ and presets. Their integrated mic also does a very good job of recording your voice during a call. You sound clear and natural on the other end of the line, but remember that background noise from louder environments, like a busy subway station, can drown your voice out entirely.See our reviewThe JLab Audio GO Air POP True Wireless are the best Bluetooth earbuds for cheap. Thanks to their good build quality and surprisingly long continuous battery life of around nine hours, they're worth checking out. Their carrying case also holds three additional charges if you need it. They can passively block out a satisfactory amount of ambient noise like office chatter; however, only rely on them if you're looking to cut down sounds like the rumble of bus engines, as they're less effective at tacking bass-range noise.Using the 'JLab Signature' EQ, they have a bass-rich sound profile that delivers a bump of extra punch and boom to mixes. The extra bass doesn't overwhelm vocals and lead instruments, so they're still versatile enough for most types of audio content. They also don't come with a companion app, meaning that the only EQ options you have are the three EQ presets built into the earbuds, which gives you significantly less control over the audio than the JBL Vibe Beam True Wireless. However, they last longer than the JBL on a single charge.See our reviewThe Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Truly Wireless are the best wireless earbuds for sound quality that we've tested. These headphones are a great choice for listening to all sorts of genres thanks to their neutral and balanced sound, which is more versatile than the similarly-priced Google Pixel Buds Pro Truly Wireless. Whether you're listening to bass-heavy genres like EDM or vocal-centric content like folk music, these buds reproduce voices and lead instruments with great clarity and accuracy. If you want to switch up their sound, there are a couple of different EQ presets in their app, too.These lightweight, comfortable earbuds have a stable fit that's great for listening on the go. They last for over 13 hours off a single charge, and their portable case offers an extra recharge just in case. That said, compared to the Google headphones, they don't have an ANC feature. As a result, they can't block out as much background noise, like bus or plane engines. You may find this a benefit, especially if you like to stay aware of your surroundings, like when you're on an outdoor run.See our review  Oct 25, 2023:                 No changes in product picks after checking to ensure they're the best for each category.
