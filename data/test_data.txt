 The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II Truly Wireless are the next generation of the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds Truly Wireless. If you value noise isolation, you'll want to check these buds out. Like their predecessor, Bose outperforms competitors like the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) Truly Wireless and Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 when it comes to blocking out background noise, thanks to their active noise cancelling (ANC) system. Bose has also changed the design of the buds themselves, making them less bulky and more customizable, improving their overall comfort and fit. There's also an additional charge in their carrying case compared to their predecessor.

Bose has also changed the design of the buds themselves, making them less bulky and more customizable, improving their overall comfort and fit. There's also an additional charge in their carrying case compared to their predecessor.The Bose QuietComfort 2 are satisfactory for neutral sound. Out of the box, they have a more bass-heavy sound than our test rig measures due to the shape of our rig's ear canals. However, the added bass subjectively muddies and clutters vocals and instruments. If you prefer a different sound, their companion app offers a graphic EQ and presets to help you adjust them. They're in-ear headphones, and their passive soundstage isn't very immersive due to their design.The Bose QuietComfort II are excellent for commute and travel. These well-built buds have a powerful ANC system, which can easily block out the low rumble of bus and plane engines as well as passenger chit-chat. They also have a comfortable fit and are very portable, thanks to their small and lightweight design. They have over six and a half hours of continuous battery life, and their carrying case supplies an additional three charges if you need it.The Bose QuietComfort 2 are great for sports and fitness. These buds have a well-built, comfortable, and stable design that won't fall out of your ear during tough workouts. They're also certified IPX4 for resistance against water splashes. Their wireless design also ensures that nothing snags the buds and pulls them out of your ears.The Bose QuietComfort 2 are good for office use. They have a comfortable fit for long days at the office, and their ANC easily tackles office chatter so that you can focus on your work. While their 6.7-hour continuous battery life may not last the whole day, their carrying case supplies an additional three charges, which is handy in a pinch.The Bose QuietComfort 2 are Bluetooth headphones and aren't designed for wireless gaming. Their latency is also likely to be too high for gaming.The Bose QuietComfort 2 are Bluetooth-only headphones, and you can't use them wired.The Bose QuietComfort II are passable for phone calls. These buds have an integrated mic, and it does an okay job of capturing your voice as speech sounds a bit boxy, like you're talking from farther away than you are. The mic also has a hard time separating speech from ambient noise, and your voice can be easily drowned out by background noise. However, if you want to tune out the outside world, the ANC does a fantastic job of reducing sound around you. The Bose QuietComfort 2 come in two color variations: 'Triple Black' and 'Soapstone'. We tested the 'Triple Black' variant, and you can see our model's label here. If you come across another variant of these headphones, please let us know in the discussions, and we'll update our review.

The Bose are more comfortable, and their ANC can block out more background noise in the bass to mid ranges, where you'll find the rumble of bus engines and ambient chatter, respectively. In comparison, the Sony headphones have a more neutral sound profile, which some users may prefer, and have more robust sound customization features. They have longer battery life and support multi-device pairing and LDAC, which is Sony's proprietary codec for hi-res audio streaming via Bluetooth. Their ANC also blocks out significantly more ambient sound in the treble range, where you'll find noise like the hum of an AC unit.

The Bose are much better for commuting, traveling, or if noise isolation is your priority, thanks to their significantly better ANC performance. You can also set their ANC system to different modes to suit the situation. However, the Denon headphones are better if you're looking for the best sound quality from your earbuds. They can stream higher-resolution audio via the aptX Lossless codec and support Spatial Audio, a virtual surround sound feature. You can use their app to create a personalized EQ based on a hearing test. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II Truly Wireless and the Denon PerL Pro True Wireless have different strengths.

Although more expensive, the Bose have a powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) as well as a companion app with graphic EQ and presets, neither of which are offered with the Status buds. However, the Status have a longer continuous battery life. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II Truly Wireless are better earbuds than the Status Between Pro True Wireless. Although more expensive, the Bose have a powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) as well as a companion app with graphic EQ and presets, neither of which are offered with the Status buds. However, the Status have a longer continuous battery life.The Bose QuietComfort 2 have a sleeker and more refined look than their predecessor, the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds Truly Wireless. They're a lot smaller and have a stem design. The manufacturer's label is on the outward-facing side. Unlike other Bose earbuds, the stability fins and ear tips are separate pieces instead of one unit, which makes it easy to swap out if you prefer a different fit. They come in two color variants: 'Triple Black' and 'Soapstone'.These buds are very comfortable. Compared to their predecessor, they're less bulky and don't go as deeply into your ears. The stability fins also feel softer on the skin, and since they're now independent from the ear tip, it's easier to ensure a comfortable fit. The buds don't put much pressure on the ear and feel lightweight. They don't pop out of your ear over time like the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) Truly Wireless either.These headphones have good controls. There's a touch-sensitive surface on each bud, which is easy to use and has good sensitivity. You can use either bud for controls, but there's no audio feedback to let you know when you've registered a command. You can also accidentally switch between ANC modes if you're adjusting the buds using the stem. On either bud:  Single tap: Plays and pauses audio. Also accepts calls. Double tap: Skips to the next track. Also ends calls. Triple tap: Skips to the previous track. Touch and hold: Cycles between ANC modes: 'Quiet', which is ANC on, and 'Aware', which is a talk-through mode, so that you can hear your environment without taking your earbuds out. You can also remap these controls to add voice assistant control. Swipe up: Raises the volume. Swipe down: Lowers the volume. These headphones have good controls.

You can use either bud for controls, but there's no audio feedback to let you know when you've registered a command. You can also accidentally switch between ANC modes if you're adjusting the buds using the stem.On either bud:Like most in-ears, these buds are very portable and can easily fit into most pockets or bags without an issue. However, the case is a lot bulkier (and heavier) than that of other truly wireless headphones like the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) Truly Wireless.These buds come with a good carrying case. It's mostly made of plastic, but it feels of better quality than the first generation. The lid feels flimsy compared to the rest of the case, and there's no locking mechanism, so it's easy to open up the lid by accident. There's a single LED light indicator to let you know when the buds are charging. The back of the case also has a Bluetooth pairing button that's slightly indented. Unfortunatly, the case doesn't support wireless charging, which is a step down from their predecessor.These buds have a good build quality but don't feel quite as premium as the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds Truly Wireless. They're mostly made of glossy plastic, except for the touch-sensitive surface on the stems, but it feels a bit cheap. The case is also made of plastic and is a little flimsy. The fins and tips are also thinner and seem prone to tearing due to the thin area where they lock onto your ears. They're certified IPX4 for resistance against water splashes, though.These buds have a very stable in-ear fit thanks to their stability fin design. You can wear them during a run or workout, and they won't fall out of your ears. Bose QuietComfort 2 earbuds 3x stability bands  3x ear tips USB-A to USB-C charging cable Carrying case Manual After firmware update 1.3.26+g1226f68, the Bose QuietComfort II have a more bass-heavy sound profile than we originally mentioned. You can see a comparison between the original frequency response and our new pass here. However, even though we tried to achieve the best seal using our testing rig, we subjectively hear more bass from the buds than our graph indicates. It's due to the shape of our test rig's ear canals, which can't capture what we hear subjectively. Overall, if you like genres like EDM and hip-hop, you'll like the extra thump, punch, and boom, but they don't sound that neutral. Vocals are particularly muddy and cluttered in mixes. Luckily, if you prefer a different sound, their companion app offers a graphic EQ and presets to help you customize their sound.These buds have outstanding frequency response consistency. Assuming you get the best fit using the included stability fins and ear tips, you'll experience consistent bass and treble delivery.After firmware 1.3.26+g1226f68, these buds produce more bass than our graph indicates. It's due to the shape of our test rig's ear canals, and subjectively, you can expect more thump, punch, and boom in mixes. While the extra bass is well-suited for genres like EDM and hip-hop, it also muddies and clutters vocals and instruments.The mid response is more uneven after firmware update 1.3.26+g1226f68, than when first released. Unfortunately, our test rig can't adequately capture the amount of bass produced by these buds due to the shape of our rig's ear canals. Subjectively, this extra bass extends into the low-mid, and muddies vocals and instruments. A dip in the mid to high-mid also nudges these sounds to the back of the mix and weakens them. In songs like I'm Good (Blue) by David Guetta and Bebe Rexha, the female vocals and piano are muddied by the bassline and sound distant.The Bose QuietComfort 2 have excellent treble accuracy. The treble response is a little tilted, resulting in detailed vocals and instruments. Sibilants are also present but not overly bright. In songs like Miss You by Oliver Tree and Robin Schulz, the high-pitched vocals in the chorus sound crisp without being piercing.The peaks and dips performance of these buds is decent. There's a small peak in the low-bass, which adds extra thump and rumble to your mixes. A dip in the high-mid affects the right driver more prominently, weakening vocals and instruments. A couple of peaks in the low to mid-treble make the upper harmonics of vocals and instruments sound harsh while sibilants like S and T sounds are piercing.The imaging performance of these buds is excellent. Bose has good quality control with their products, and their headphones usually have well-matched drivers. Our unit's L/R drivers are also well-matched in group delay, phase, amplitude, and frequency response. Although there's a bump in our unit's phase response, it's a very small area and can be hard to hear with real-life content. Audio becomes louder in the left driver at around 920Hz and louder in the right driver afterward. However, imaging varies depending on the manufacturer's quality control and ergonomics.The passive soundstage performance of these buds is bad, which is normal from in-ears. To create an immersive soundstage, your outer ear has to be activated by sound. However, in-ears bypass your outer ear. This results in a soundstage that feels small, unnatural, and as if sound is coming from inside your head rather than from speakers placed in the room around you.The weighted harmonic distortion performance is very good. There's a spike in the mid-treble, but it's a bit hard to hear with real-life content. The rest of the frequencies fall within good levels, resulting in mostly clean and pure audio reproduction.These are the settings used to test these headphones, and our results are only valid in this configuration.The noise isolation performance of the Bose QuietComfort 2 is fantastic. They can block out a significant amount of ambient noise, especially compared to their predecessor or their competitors like the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) Truly Wireless. Overall, they're well-suited for reducing low engine rumbles, ambient chatter, and the high-pitched hum of AC units.The leakage performance of these buds is great. Most leakage is concentrated in the treble range and sounds fairly thin. If you like to crank up the volume to your favorite tunes, others around you won't hear it.The recording quality of the integrated mic is okay. Your voice sounds boxy and as if the mic is a little far from your mouth. That said, your voice is still understandable.The mic's noise handling performance is poor. The mic sits far away from your mouth, and as a result, it has a hard time capturing your voice clearly, especially in noisy environments like a busy office. That said, if you're talking in a quieter environment, like at home, you won't have problems being heard clearly.The Bose QuietComfort II's battery performance is decent. Like the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds Truly Wireless, the manufacturer advertises them to last six hours continuously, and we measured over that. However, battery life can vary depending on use. Luckily, the carrying case holds three additional charges, which is handy in a pinch. Firmware update 1.3.26+g1226f68 also added single bud listening, so you can use either bud while the other one charges in the carrying case. If you're looking for in-ears with a longer continuous battery life, check out the Status Between Pro True Wireless.The Bose Music app is great. It's pretty simple to use and offers a lot of features. You can see a video of the app in use here. You can check the battery level, adjust volume, and remap controls. You can also select different modes, which you can then set to a custom amount of ANC, which is handy if you prefer more or less noise isolation depending on your activity or location. To ensure you get a good fit, there's an ear tip fit test, and there's a graphic EQ as well as presets to help you adjust their sound as well.The Bose QuietComfort 2's Bluetooth performance is decent. They don't support multi-device or NFC pairing, but their latency is quite low on Android and iOS devices, making them a solid choice for streaming video. Their PC latency is higher, and you'll notice that your audio and visuals fall out of sync. Latency can vary depending on the app and device you're using.These headphones come with a USB-C to USB-A cable to recharge their carrying case.These earbuds can connect to Bluetooth-enabled PCs with full audio and mic compatibility. However, this is the only way you can connect these headphones to your PC.These headphones come with a carrying case with a USB-C port for charging their case.A good headset can make a big difference when playing games. Whether you like to get immersed in the game with the music or sound effects or need to hear every enemy footstep, choosing the right headphones for you can be quite a task. You should look at overall build quality, how comfortable they are, how they sound, and if the microphone sounds good. Most wired audiophile headphones will be a good option if you don't need a microphone.We've tested over 755 headphones, and below are our recommendations for the best headsets to buy for gaming. Also, see our recommendations for the best PS4 headsets, the best Xbox One headsets, the best PS5 headsets, and the best Xbox Series X/S headsets.The best headset for gaming we've tested is the Audeze Maxwell Wireless. These sturdy, feature-packed wireless headphones come in Xbox and PlayStation variants compatible with PCs. They stand out from many other gaming headsets because they use planar magnetic drivers, which helps them produce a more extended bass response and create a wider passive soundstage relative to dynamic driver headphones like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro.Their default sound profile is neutral, so elements like footsteps, explosions, and voices in cutscenes are reproduced accurately. You can also use their app's EQ presets for sound customization. These headphones support Dolby Atmos, a virtual surround sound feature to make your listening experience more immersive. They come with a USB dongle with a low-latency connection, so your audio and video will stay in sync while gaming. You have plenty of options for connecting to your console or PC.The Audeze also support multi-device pairing, so you can hear audio from your phone via Bluetooth and your console simultaneously, as long as you use an analog or wired USB connection. For online gamers, the detachable boom mic offers great performance. It makes your voice sound clear and understandable, and the mic has outstanding noise handling, so it won't be drowned out by noise in the background. However, these headphones are back-ordered, so getting a pair can take a while.See our reviewThe Logitech G PRO X 2 LIGHTSPEED Wireless is the best gaming headset we've tested at this price point. Unlike the Audeze Maxwell Wireless, these comfortable cans don't come in console-specific variants. They have wireless support on PCs and PlayStation consoles, but you can only use them via analog on Xbox. On the upside, they support Bluetooth, so you can connect them to your Nintendo Switch.Their bass-heavy sound makes gameplay feel more exciting without drowning out vocals. You can't transfer over EQ settings from their companion app to consoles like the PS5, though. Their 97-hour battery life can easily handle many days' worth of gaming before needing a recharge, while their dongle ensures that your audio and visuals stay in sync. If you like to game with others, their detachable boom mic also separates your voice from background noise very well, so speech is heard clearly.Unfortunately, the recording quality is just okay, and your voice sounds unnatural to whoever's on the other end of the line. If you're looking for headphones with better recording quality, try the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro. The boom mic on these wired-only cans captures clear and natural-sounding speech. They even come with a GameDAC that puts controls like EQ and channel mixing at your fingertips. However, they aren't as comfortable or well-built as the Logitech.See our reviewThe SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Wireless are the best headphones for gaming in the mid-range we've tested. Their wireless USB dongle provides low enough latency for gaming, so your audio and video won't be out of sync. Similar to the previous picks, they have a bass-rich sound profile with a well-balanced mid-range, so voices are present and clear but can also sound veiled and lack detail. Fortunately, the app features a graphic EQ and presets for sound customization.While they don't last as long continuously as the Logitech G PRO X 2 LIGHTSPEED Wireless, their roughly 30-hour battery life will still get you through long dungeon crawls. You can also use them wired in a pinch. They have a high noise floor while monitoring your voice, and while that's a downside if you play a lot of multiplayer games, the mic still makes your voice sound clear and natural.These headphones also support Bluetooth, which allows you to mix chat audio or music from your phone and game audio. They also come in a few variants for different consoles. We tested the 7X variant, which is meant for Xbox but can also connect with PlayStation using the USB dongle, although any changes you made in the app, like sound customizations, won't apply. The 7 and 7P variants don't support a wireless connection with Xbox but might be the better choice if you only use a PC or PlayStation.See our reviewIf you're looking for a budget-friendly headset for gaming, check out the Logitech G535 LIGHTSPEED Wireless. These inexpensive headphones are missing some of the previous picks' helpful features, like Bluetooth, a wired connection, and Xbox compatibility. However, if you're a PlayStation gamer or looking for the best PC gaming headset in the budget range, they're worth a look, thanks to their wireless dongle that provides a low latency connection for gaming.Their default sound lacks low-bass, so your audio is missing some thump and rumble. There's some overemphasis in the high-bass range that adds warmth and punch, which can help bring out sound effects like footsteps in games. They work with companion software that includes a graphic EQ with sound presets and virtual surround sound features that can help create a more immersive listening experience. However, if you use the mic often when gaming, remember that it doesn't have the best performance and makes your voice sound thin compared to the pricier headphones here.See our reviewThe best budget gaming headset we've tested is the Logitech G432. A reputable brand like Logitech can be a safe bet if you care about quality and durability, as lower-priced models on the market can have glaring flaws like driver mismatches and faulty frames. Unlike the Logitech G535 LIGHTSPEED Wireless, the G432 are wired-only but still offer a solid performance rivaling more expensive wireless models. These headphones also have a good mic performance, so your voice is easily understood when gaming with friends. Their lightweight, comfortable fit is suitable for long gaming sessions as well.Their sound profile is light on bass, which isn't ideal for action-packed games, but you can customize it with a graphic EQ and presets in the companion app. Their wired USΒ dongle provides a low latency connection and works with PlayStation consoles, but it's incompatible with Xbox. You can still use the headphones with these consoles if you plug them into a controller, but it'll mean you can't use applied changes made in the EQ via the companion app.See our reviewThe best cheap gaming headset we've tested is the Logitech G435 LIGHTSPEED Wireless. Logitech manufactures a solid lineup of low-cost gaming headphones that perform very well. In the case of the G435, their plastic frame isn't the sturdiest, but they have decently low latency over both Bluetooth and their wireless USB dongle. They also have a slightly warm sound profile with extra bass to make explosions and footsteps more prominent in the mix. Dialogue and instruments also sound bright and present, but you can't adjust their sound to your preferences since they don't have an EQ.They also have poor passive noise isolation performance and will let in a lot of noise and leak a lot of game audio to those around you. Fortunately, their mic makes your voice sound bright and clear, though a little unnatural, and their nearly 20-hour battery will last you through several play sessions. While these features make this the best PC gaming headset and the best for PlayStation consoles we've tested at this price range, this model sadly isn't compatible with Xbox consoles.See our reviewThe best open-back gaming headset we've tested is the Drop + Sennheiser/EPOS PC38X. These wired headphones are around the same price as the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Wireless, but you might prefer them if you like your game audio to be as immersive as possible. Their open design helps them create a soundstage that seems wider and more spacious than the closed-back options on this list. While they lack a bit of low-bass, they have a well-balanced sound profile suitable for action-packed games or dialogue-heavy cutscenes. However, they aren't ideal for use in a noisy or shared space since they don't block out ambient sound and leak a lot of audio by design.They're well-built and comfortable to wear, with a choice of either microfiber or velour ear cup padding. They also have a boom mic that makes your voice sound natural and full-bodied during multiplayer games. Because of their wired design, they work with most consoles, and you don't need to worry about latency. Their onboard controls are limited; you can flip up the mic to mute it and adjust the volume with a wheel on one ear cup.See our review  Oct 26, 2023:                 Added the Razer BlackShark V2 HyperSpeed Wireless to the Notable Mentions.                 Sep 27, 2023:                 No product pick changes. Some text edits for clarity.                 Aug 28, 2023:                 We've added the Turtle Beach Stealth Pro Wireless to the Notable Mentions as they're often compared to the Audeze Maxwell Wireless.                 Aug 04, 2023:                 We've made minor changes to this article to keep it up-to-date and accurate. Our recommendations have remained the same, though.                 Jul 11, 2023:                 We've replaced the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro with the Logitech G PRO X 2 LIGHTSPEED Wireless, as the Logitech offer more connection options and are more comfortable. We've also added the Astro A30 to Notable Mentions and removed the SteelSeries Arctis 7+ Wireless, Xbox Wireless Headset, and Razer Kaira Pro Wireless for Xbox.               Our recommendations above are what we think are currently the best gaming headphones to buy for most people in each price range. We factor in the price (cheaper headphones win over pricier ones if the difference isn't worth it), feedback from our visitors, and availability (no headphones that are difficult to find or almost out of stock everywhere).If you would like to choose for yourself, here is the list of all our headphones reviews, sorted by their wireless gaming performance. Be careful not to get caught up in the details. There are no perfect headphones. Personal taste, preference, and listening habits will matter more in your selection, especially if you don't care about having a microphone or wireless features.While headphones with active noise cancelling (ANC) have been around for a long time, the technology has progressed significantly in the past few years and has become much more common. ANC headphones can help keep you focused in a noisy office or block out engine noise on planes, trains, or buses. Not all ANC performs the same, and there are now many options in every possible price range, making it hard to know which ones are worth it.We've tested over 220 pairs of headphones with ANC, and below are our recommendations for noise cancelling over-ears. If you prefer an earbud design, you'll want to check out our picks for the best noise cancelling earbuds instead. If you're looking for something in a specific price range, also consider our picks for the best noise cancelling headphones under $200 and the best budget noise cancelling headphones.The best noise cancelling headphones we've tested are the Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless. While they're the previous generation of the Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless, these premium over-ears offer a better noise isolation performance than their successor. Their ANC system does an outstanding job of blocking out the low rumble of bus engines, office chit-chat, and the hum of computer fans, making them a great choice for on-the-go use. With their ANC on, these headphones last over 37 hours continuously. They're equipped with an auto-off timer to help conserve battery life when not in use, or you can just use them over a wired connection if you don't want to worry about running out of juice.These over-ears have a bass-heavy default sound profile that delivers immense thump, rumble, and boom to mixes. If you find that the bass overwhelms vocals and lead instruments, their companion app offers customization via a graphic EQ and presets. If you're looking for ANC headphones with a more neutral default sound, it's worth checking out the Bose QuietComfort 45/QC45 Wireless instead. While they still have a touch of extra bass, it's less exaggerated and bloated-sounding than the Sony. They're also more comfortable, thanks to their lightweight fit, which doesn't clamp as tightly on your head. However, their ANC blocks less background noise across the spectrum.See our reviewIf you're looking for more affordable over-ears without sacrificing ANC performance, consider the Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless. Unlike the Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless, these over-ears have an adaptive ANC system designed to detect your current environment and adjust its performance accordingly. This feature does a fantastic job of blocking out noise across the spectrum, meaning you can enjoy busy commutes and cafes in peace. You can also switch to manual ANC via the companion app, which has five different levels if you want to customize the amount of ambient noise you hear and use the ANC while connected via analog.Their V-shaped sound profile is a solid choice if you listen to a lot of rock and pop music, as they deliver extra thump and boom while higher-pitched instruments like cymbals are crisp. Using their companion app's graphic EQ and presets, you can fine-tune their sound to suit your preferences. They last over 27 hours continuously and support multi-device pairing, meaning you can stay connected to your PC and smartphone simultaneously. For a little less, they remain a great noise-cancelling pick.See our reviewThe best budget-friendly ANC headphones we've tested are the Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Wireless. Although they aren't quite as sturdy as the Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless, and some users have reported that their unit's headband or hinges crack with regular use, they deliver a comparable noise isolation experience thanks to their adjustable ANC system. They can easily reduce commuter noise like the rumble of engines and ambient chatter. Unfortunately, Anker removed the ability to use the ANC while wired in later product batches, so if you purchase them, you'll likely get a pair of headphones that don't support this feature. It's a huge downside if you want to use them for in-flight entertainment, but it's less of an issue if you use them wirelessly in your day-to-day life.These comfortable over-ears have over 44 hours of continuous battery life with their ANC on, which is great for long days on the go. They also support multi-device pairing, meaning you can simultaneously stay paired with two devices. They have an excited sound out of the box, delivering intense thump, punch, and warmth to your mixes while ensuring that vocals and instruments are bright. You can adjust their sound using their companion app's graphic EQ and presets to suit your tastes.See our reviewIf you're on a tight budget, check out the Anker Soundcore Life Q20 Wireless. This manufacturer dominates the low-to-mid-range over-ear market, especially for ANC. These headphones are no exception, delivering a good overall noise isolation performance. Although they're weaker than their successors when tackling the rumble of bus and plane engines, they do a better job cutting down office chit-chat and the hum of AC fans. They don't have ANC presets, but they support ANC while wired, which is handy if you want to watch in-flight entertainment.These headphones have a V-shaped sound profile that delivers intense bass to the audio, while vocals and lead instruments are bright and sparkly. Their extra boom and punch muddy the rest of your mix, and, unlike the Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Wireless, they lack sound customization features to help you adjust them to your preferences. While they have a comfortable fit and last over 32 hours continuously, their affordable price reflects their build quality. Their plasticky hinges feel hollow, making them the weakest point of their frame.See our reviewFocal is known for their high-end audiophile headphones, which don't have noise cancelling. However, if you care about audio quality, consider the Focal Bathys Wireless, which bridge the gap between high-quality sound and a casual, wireless design, offering the best of both worlds. These premium cans won't isolate you from noise quite as well as our top pick, but they still deliver a very good overall performance. They also have a wired DAC mode, which can help deliver your favorite tunes in higher quality than their default wireless mode. If you want to use them via Bluetooth, you can use aptX Adaptive for streaming hi-res audio with low latency.Out of the box, these over-ears have a bass-rich sound profile that delivers satisfying punch, thump, and boom. While vocals and instruments sound veiled, you can customize their sound to your liking using their companion app's graphic EQ and presets. Their comfortable fit means you can also wear them for long periods without significant fatigue, and with their ANC on, they last over 29 hours continuously. They're a great pick for audiophiles who still want a distraction-free listening experience while on the go.See our review  Oct 06, 2023:                 We've updated this article's text to ensure it's up-to-date and accurate. Our picks haven't changed.                 Sep 11, 2023:                 Removed the Sony WH-H910N/h.ear on 3 Wireless as its price is the same as our current mid-range pick. Since the Anker offer better noise isolation, we've kept them in the article.                 Aug 17, 2023:                 We've made minor changes to the text to improve its accuracy. Our recommendations have remained the same.                 Jul 20, 2023:                 We've removed the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II Truly Wireless from the Notable Mentions to place the focus on over-ear headphones.                 Jun 22, 2023:                 We've added the Focal Bathys Wireless as the 'Best Sounding Noise Cancelling Headphones' as they have a unique DAC design and support aptX Adaptive, which can help improve audio quality compared to other picks on this list.               Our recommendations above are what we think are currently the best headphones with ANC to buy for most people in each price range. We factor in the price (cheaper headphones win over pricier ones if the difference isn't worth it), feedback from our visitors, and availability (no headphones that are difficult to find or almost out of stock everywhere).If you would like to choose for yourself, here is the list of all our reviews for headphones with an ANC feature. Be careful not to get caught up in the details. There are no perfect headphones and the level at which you play your music will naturally drown the ambient noise of lower amplitudes.In-ears or earbuds can be much more portable than bulky over-ears and help passively block out background noise for those on the go. They can be great at the gym and are easy to toss into your pocket when you get off the bus or arrive at the office. While earbuds technically rest at the edge of the ear canal and in-ears have barrel-shaped tips inserted deep into the ear, people often use the two terms interchangeably. In-ears tend to be more common, though some people find them uncomfortable and prefer the less intrusive fit of earbuds.We've tested over 290 pairs of earbuds and in-ear headphones. Below are our recommendations for the best in-ears and earbuds to purchase. Check out our picks for the best truly wireless earbuds, the best wireless earbuds and in-ears, and the best sounding wireless earbuds.The best in-ears we've tested are the Sony WF-1000XM5 Truly Wireless. These premium in-ears are the next generation of the Sony WF-1000XM4 Truly Wireless, offering improved performance and design. They have a smaller and more rounded shape than their predecessor, with memory foam ear tips that improve their noise isolation performance. There's also an ANC feature to help block out more bass-heavy background noises like bus and plane engines. You may not experience a significant difference between ANC on and off, though, since they have a high passive isolation due to their ear tips.Their memory foam ear tips aren't comfortable for everyone, though. While the headphones come with a couple of different sizes of tips to help you get the right fit, the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II Truly Wireless are a more comfortable alternative since they don't have such a deep in-ear fit. Their default sound isn't quite as neutral as what you get with the Sony right out-of-the-box, though, which isn't ideal for everyone. Both headphones offer a lot of sound customization tools, including a graphic EQ and presets. Only the Sony earbuds offer a virtual soundstage feature called 360 Reality Audio, which analyzes your ear shape to create a custom sound profile. We'll also be sure to update this review as we test the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Truly Wireless.See our reviewIf you still want a premium design but don't want to pay top dollar, try the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) Truly Wireless. Like their predecessor, the Apple AirPods Pro Truly Wireless, they've got a few features you won't find anywhere else on this list, like an H2 chip for seamless pairing with devices in your Apple ecosystem and Spatial Audio for a more immersive audio experience. While their noise isolation isn't quite on par with the Sony WF-1000XM5 Truly Wireless, they still do an excellent job of tackling hard-to-block noise like rumbly plane engines and ambient chatter. With their ANC on, they last just under six hours continuously, though their case holds four extra charges if you need it.Overall, they're well-built and comfortable enough for long listening sessions. Their design can wiggle out of your ears over time, which is annoying. They have a warm sound profile, making vocals and instruments seem cozy; this means they're well-suited for most kinds of content. However, they lack built-in EQ or presets to help you tweak their sound, so if this matters, check out the Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 instead. They offer similar noise isolation and sound customization features via their companion app. However, they aren't as comfortable.See our reviewThe Google Pixel Buds Pro Truly Wireless are the best in-ear headphones at the mid-range level we've tested. Despite the smaller price tag, these earbuds still have plenty of useful extra features. They support multi-device pairing, meaning you can stay connected with your phone and computer simultaneously, and they have an ANC feature that does an excellent job of blocking out noise. Google Pixel users can also take advantage of the Spatial Audio feature meant to help create a more immersive soundstage.The earbuds have a solid continuous battery life of around seven hours and come with a case with two extra charges. Their slightly V-shaped sound profile emphasizes the thump and rumble of low bass, while instruments and lead vocals sound clear and bright. However, they can pop out of your ears over time. This can be annoying and affect their bass delivery if you can't achieve a consistent fit. The Sony LinkBuds S Truly Wireless are another good mid-range option. They're more comfortable for most people and not as prone to slipping out of place, but their ANC doesn't block bass-range noise like rumbling engines as effectively.See our reviewConsider the Anker Soundcore Space A40 Truly Wireless if you want a more affordable option. These earbuds do sacrifice some higher-end features, like virtual surround sound. Out of the box, they also have a less neutral sound profile than the Google Pixel Buds Pro Truly Wireless. Still, thanks to their adaptive ANC feature, they have a fantastic noise cancelling performance, which can help block out noise like rumbling engines and background conversations. They support multi-device pairing, meaning you can stay connected with your phone and computer simultaneously. They have a solid eight hours of continuous battery life and come with a case with four additional charges.By default, the Anker have a warm sound profile that works well for genres like rock and jazz, but mixes lack low-bass, and voices and instruments are missing some detail. Still, you can use a graphic EQ and presets in the companion app to adjust the sound to your taste. If you're looking for similarly performing buds with a different physical design and more bass, consider the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC Truly Wireless. They have a stem design, which some people may prefer compared to the Space A40's rounded shape, and deliver a lot more thump, rumble, and boom. However, the added bass seeps into their mids and slightly muddies vocals and instruments.See our reviewThe best budget earbuds we've tested are the JBL Vibe Beam True Wireless. These headphones come with some features that are uncommon for budget-friendly buds, including a parametric EQ to tweak their sound profile. They're rated IP56 for dust and water resistance, so a little rain during a run isn't an issue, and they have Ambient Aware and TalkThru modes that you can use to hear ambient sound when you want to stay aware of your surroundings.With these earbuds, you'll have to sacrifice a bit of comfort compared to the Anker Soundcore Space A40 Truly Wireless. They lack an ANC feature, too. If you're looking for a budget-friendly option that can block out noise during your commute or at the office, the TOZO NC7 Truly Wireless offer an ANC feature for around the same price. They do an impressive job of blocking out ambient sound, including the low rumble of bus and plane engines and background chit-chat at work. However, they don't have a companion app or sound customization features like the JBL.See our reviewIf you mostly listen to bass-heavy genres, like metal, hip-hop, and EDM, then you want earbuds that can pack a solid punch and thump. While other earbuds might try to do this by overemphasizing the bass in the mix, this can cause distortion and create sound artifacts that make the listening experience less pleasant. Instead, the Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 have an extremely neutral bass profile and an underemphasized treble range. As such, they can reproduce bass-range audio with outstanding fidelity. If you'd prefer a different mix, their companion app has a graphic EQ and presets to help you personalize their sound.These headphones are also lightweight, well-built, and have an IPX4 rating for protection against water splashes, making them a good choice for moderate workouts. If you're using them for your daily commute, they will keep you isolated from the low rumble of bus engines and the noisy chatter from nearby commuters. However, it doesn't perform as well as the Sony WF-1000XM5 Truly Wireless in this regard.See our reviewIf you're looking for wired in-ears with high sound quality, the MOONDROP Blessing 3 are the best in-ear monitors (IEMs) we've tested. These wired in-ears don't have features like ANC or a mic, although you can buy a separate cable with an in-line mic if you want to make calls. However, unlike most earbuds, they use a hybrid driver design to improve sound quality and have a very neutral sound profile. They accurately reproduce the thump, punch, and boom of bass, while instruments and vocals sound clear and accurate. They're very well-built and comfortable, with earbuds made of plastic and stainless steel. Their cables loop around your ears to keep them in place even if you shake your head. Despite the lack of ANC, they block out an impressive amount of mid-range and high-pitched noise, so you won't hear as much background chit-chat or humming from an A/C unit.However, the price might be a bit much if you're not looking for a premium pair of IEMs. The MOONDROP Aria are much more budget-friendly and have a similar wired design. Their sound is also quite neutral, but they don't reproduce bass as well and have a less well-balanced mid-range, which can make instruments and vocals sound pushed back. They lack the Blessing 3's premium build and won't block out nearly as much noise. Still, they offer good audio quality and a versatile sound profile at a more affordable price.See our review  Oct 25, 2023:                 Confirmed product picks. Some text edits for clarity.                 Sep 26, 2023:                 We've added a comparison between the Anker Soundcore Space A40 Truly Wireless and the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC Truly Wireless, as both buds have similar price points and performances but with different looks. We've also moved the Beats Powerbeats Pro Truly Wireless to Notable Mentions.                 Aug 28, 2023:                 Replaced the Bose QuietComfort II Earbuds Truly Wireless with the Sony WF-1000XM5 Truly Wireless as the top pick. Replaced the Jaybird Vista 2 Truly Wireless with the Beats Powerbeats Pro Truly Wireless as 'Best For Running'.                 Aug 04, 2023:                 Replaced the Anker Soundcore Life Dot 2 Truly Wireless with the JBL Vibe Beam True Wireless as the best budget earbuds. The Anker aren't easy to find in stock, and the JBL offer sound customization features.                 Jul 09, 2023:                 Replaced the MOONDROP Aria with the MOONDROP Blessing 3 because of their better build quality and more neutral sound. Added the TOZO NC7 Truly Wireless as an ANC alternative to the Anker Life Dot 2 Truly Wireless.               Our recommendations above are what we think are currently the best in-ear headphones and earbuds to buy for most people in each price range. We factor in the price (cheaper headphones win over pricier ones if the difference isn't worth it), feedback from our visitors, and availability (no headphones that are difficult to find or almost out of stock everywhere).If you would like to choose for yourself, here is the list of all our reviews for earbuds and in-ears. Be careful not to get caught up in the details. There are no perfect headphones. Personal taste, preference, and listening habits will matter more in your selection.Whether your phone has nixed the audio jack or you prefer the freedom of going wireless, Bluetooth headphones are a great way to enjoy your favorite music cable-free. There are a couple of disadvantages compared to wired headphones, like needing to keep an eye on battery levels and possible sync issues when watching videos, but not having to worry about tangled cords when you're running out the door on a busy morning makes wireless headphones worth it for many.We've tested over 750 pairs of headphones, and below are our recommendations for the best wireless headphones to buy. Also, check out our recommendations for the best wireless earbuds, the best true wireless earbuds, and the best budget wireless headphones.The Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless are the best wireless headphones that we've tested. Although they're the previous generation of the Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless, these premium over-ears have a powerful active noise cancelling (ANC) system that outperforms their successor. They can cut down the low rumble of bus engines and block out office chatter. They also last over 37 hours continuously with the ANC on and have a bass-heavy sound profile that delivers extra thump, rumble, and boom to mixes.Unfortunately, with these headphones, vocals and instruments sound muddy and cluttered. Luckily, their companion app offers a graphic EQ and presets to help you fine-tune their sound. They also support Sony's 360 Reality Audio, which can help create a more immersive audio experience. To access this feature, you'll need to subscribe to a streaming service that supplies compatible audio files, like Tidal.People often compare these over-ears to the Bose QuietComfort 45/QC45 Wireless, which are also high-end ANC headphones. While the Sony headphones have the edge for noise isolation, the Bose are still a solid choice if you're looking for a more comfortable fit, as they're lighter and clamp a bit less tightly on your head. However, this is partly due to their flimsier plastic frame, which some users may find cheap-feeling for their price point.See our reviewThe Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless are a more affordable alternative to our top pick. These premium headphones are as sturdy and durable as the Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless, and their comfortable fit is great for longer listening sessions. Since they last over 62 hours off a single charge, you don't have to worry about running out of juice during longer days on the go. Their default sound is bass-heavy, and their companion app gives you access to lots of customization features to switch up their sound to your liking.These headphones also support multi-device pairing, so you can stay connected with your phone and computer simultaneously, as well as aptX and aptX HD codecs for higher-quality audio streaming. Like the Sony headphones, they have an ANC feature, but it can't block out as much background sound, especially bass-range noises like rumbling engines. If you want a better ANC performance, you might prefer the Sony WH-H910N/h.ear on 3 Wireless. Their build quality directly reflects their cheaper price tag, but they have significantly better noise isolation, so they're a better choice for your commute or next trip.See our reviewThe Anker Soundcore Life Q45 Wireless are another great pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones available for less. These well-built and comfortable headphones offer an outstanding noise isolation performance that's great for your commute. Their active noise cancellation (ANC) system is nearly as good as what you get with the Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless, and it can easily block out the noise from bus engines and chatty coworkers. Their 28-hour continuous battery life is great for active days on the go, and they support multi-device pairing, too, so you can easily switch up your audio source.When it comes to sound, these headphones aren't quite as neutral-sounding as the Sennheiser right out of the box. Instead, they have a very excited, V-shaped sound profile with plenty of boomy bass and bright treble. They're well-suited for rock and pop, but fans of jazz or folk may find instruments and vocals sound veiled and lacking detail. You can fix it, however, with the companion app's graphic EQ and presets, which let you personalize the sound to your liking. For the price, these versatile headphones offer a really solid performance.See our reviewThe Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Wireless are our top budget pick. These headphones are less comfortable than the Anker Soundcore Life Q45 Wireless and leak more audio at high volumes, so they aren't ideal if you like blasting your music at the office. Still, their ANC performance almost matches the Q45. When set to 'Transport' mode, it blocks out an outstanding amount of sound, including rumbly bus engines, making them well-suited for your daily commute. However, there's a noticeable difference in sound quality depending on if the ANC is on or off. When turned off, your audio is somewhat hollow and thin compared to the fuller sound you hear with the ANC on.Out of the box, they have a bass-heavy sound profile that can make mixes muddy and instruments sound cluttered. If you prefer a more neutral sound, their app includes an EQ and presets for sound customization. They also support multi-device pairing, and their continuous playback time of over 44 hours will last through long days on the move. If you're looking for a slightly cheaper alternative, consider the Wyze Noise-Cancelling Headphones Wireless. They feel studier and offer similar in-app sound customization features. However, their ANC can't block out as much lower-frequency background noise, and their battery doesn't last as long on a single charge.See our reviewCheck out the Anker Soundcore Life Q20 Wireless for the most economical option. With three picks in a row from Anker, it's evident that this manufacturer dominates the lower-cost end of the market. These are no exception, and although they're a lot simpler in design than their successors on this list, they're still worth checking out if you're willing to sacrifice extra features for a lower price. Their build reflects their affordability, as the plasticky hinges feel hollow and could be prone to damage over time.These comfortable over-ears have a V-shaped sound profile. It's well-suited for genres like pop and rock that benefit from extra bass and brightness. However, they don't have any customization features to help you adjust their sound if you prefer something more neutral. However, you can't adjust their ANC level to suit your environment like the Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Wireless. They also fall short when blocking out the low rumble from a bus or plane engine, but they're much better at reducing office-type noise like ambient chit-chat and whiny computer fans. They last over 32 hours continuously; you can use them wired if you run out of power.See our reviewIf you want headphones optimized for sound quality, you'll want to check out the Focal Bathys Wireless. With a wireless design and ANC, these audiophile headphones stand out among other hi-fi models that typically are open-back and wired. You can stream your favorite hi-res tracks over Bluetooth using aptX-Adaptive or wired via their USB-DAC connection, which converts digital audio signals to analog. Their default sound profile provides ample thump, punch, and boom to compliment more bass-heavy genres, while vocals and instruments still sound present but are slightly pushed to the back of the mix. Their companion app also has a graphic EQ and presets to give you full reign over their sound.Their ANC is also very good and has a few isolation settings. While it can't cut out as much low-bass noise, like rumbly bus engines or heavy traffic, as the Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless, these headphones can easily isolate you from ambient chit-chat and whiny PC fans. They also support multi-device pairing, are comfortable enough for extended wear without fatigue, and have a 29-hour continuous battery life that will last several workdays without recharging.See our reviewThe best Bluetooth headphones for calls we've tested are the Bose 700 Headphones Wireless. Even though low audio and mic quality are limitations of Bluetooth technology, these stand out from other options as they offer the best mic performance on this list. Their mic does a good job of recording your voice clearly, even in moderately noisy environments. They have a dedicated button for muting and unmuting the mic and last over 20 hours continuously, and these headphones have a very comfortable fit for long workdays.Their default sound profile keeps vocals clear and accurate in your audio, so voices over the phone are easy to understand. Their app also features a graphic EQ that you can use to customize their sound to suit you. Even though their ANC feature doesn't perform as well as the Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless', it still does an excellent job of blocking background noise, so you can hear the person you're speaking with even if you're calling from a busy office.If you don't mind sacrificing ANC for better battery life, check out the Audeze Maxwell Wireless. Even though they're gaming headphones, they look fairly nondescript. They last over 77 hours on a single charge, and their boom mic better isolates your voice from background noise than the Bose's integrated mic. However, the Audeze are less comfortable.See our review  Oct 18, 2023:                 We've made minor changes to this article's text to improve readability and accuracy, but our picks have remained the same.

Their planar magnetic drivers also help them stand out from the rest of the picks on this list, which have dynamic drivers. This allows them to produce a more extended bass, ensure low distortion, and create a more immersive soundstage than dynamic headphones, like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless.There's a caveat, though: they're pretty heavy due to their drivers, and while they have a ski-band headband to help distribute their weight, they can still cause fatigue over time. Since the headband only has three levels of adjustment, it can also be tricky to get a good fit, and you'll notice a drop in bass delivery if you have thick hair or wear glasses. Out of the box, these headphones have a fairly neutral sound, and you can adjust them to your liking using their companion app's EQ presets.These Bluetooth-compatible headphones last over 77 hours continuously and have low latency, so your audio and visuals stay in sync during the heat of the moment. Also, they come with a removable boom mic and an integrated mic. If you're gaming with others, you'll want to stick with the boom mic, which offers better overall performance, ensuring you're heard clearly, even in noisy environments. Unfortunately, these headphones are hard to find in stock and are back-ordered through some retailers, but they're worth the wait if you don't mind pre-ordering them.See our reviewThe Logitech G PRO X 2 LIGHTSPEED Wireless is the best wireless headset for gaming in the upper mid-range that we've tested. Unlike the Audeze Maxwell Wireless, the Logitech have a more PC-oriented design in mind. If you're a PlayStation gamer, you can use them wirelessly on your console, but they don't have any Xbox support. Still, they have low latency, and the manufacturer advertises 50 hours of playback time, which will easily last through long gaming sessions.These comfortable over-ears have a neutral sound that you can adjust using their companion software's EQ and presets. You can't access any saved settings away from your PC, though. If you like to game with friends, their boom mic offers an okay recording quality, but it shines in noisy environments. The mic can separate your voice from background sound so you're easily understood.Unfortunately, unlike the Audeze, you can't use Bluetooth and the wireless dongle simultaneously, so you'll only receive audio from one device via one connection at a time. If you're looking for gaming headphones that are a little more console-friendly, try the Astro A30 Wireless. They come in console-specific variants and even support Bluetooth and non-Bluetooth simultaneously, allowing you to stay connected to your smartphone and console. However, they aren't as comfortable.See our reviewThe SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Wireless is the best wireless headset for gaming in the mid-range we've tested. Stepping down in price means these headphones won't feel as premium as the Logitech G PRO X 2 LIGHTSPEED Wireless. However, they come in three console-specific variants; the 7X variant will give you the most versatility since it's wirelessly compatible with both Xbox and PlayStation consoles. Thanks to their USB dongle, they have low latency, ensuring that your audio and visuals stay in sync during the heat of gameplay.They even support Bluetooth, so you can stay connected to your PC and console simultaneously, and they last over 33 hours continuously. Their mic offers good overall performance, and teammates hear you clearly even in noisy environments. Their bass-rich sound profile is also well-suited for action-packed gameplay as they deliver satisfying thump, punch, and warmth. While dialogue and instruments are veiled, you can customize their sound using their companion software's graphic EQ and presets.Unfortunately, their soundstage isn't very spacious or immersive since they're closed-back. However, this design can help block background noise like ambient chatter and reduce audio bleed. Check out the Razer Barracuda Wireless if you want a slightly cheaper option. They have a longer continuous battery life and more low-bass, but their mid-range isn't as neutral, and their mic isn't as good.See our reviewIf you want to spend a little less, the Logitech G535 LIGHTSPEED Wireless are worth a look. These budget-friendly headphones have a simple plastic build, and you can't detach or retract their mic. However, if that doesn't deter you, they have what you need in an affordable pair of wireless headphones, thanks to their low latency via USB dongle and over 35 hours of continuous playback time. Their soundstage also feels open, wide, and natural, creating a more immersive gaming experience.These over-ears have a well-balanced sound profile out-of-the-box. Although they lack low-bass, they have a bit of extra boom to help emphasize sound effects in your game. Dialogue and instruments also sound clear and detailed. However, the headphones are prone to inconsistencies in audio delivery, so it's important to take the time to adjust their fit to your liking. Luckily, they're compatible with Logitech G HUB software, so you can tweak their sound using the graphic EQ and presets.See our reviewIf you're looking for something that won't break the bank, the Logitech G435 LIGHTSPEED Wireless are the best wireless gaming headphones for cheap. Thanks to their slightly warm sound profile, these headphones have a touch of extra boomy bass to emphasize gunshots and explosions in your favorite games. They're well-balanced across most of the rest of the range, ensuring that dialogue and footsteps are present and clear. However, sibilants sound dull, like S and T sounds in dialogue.That said, these headphones aren't as well-built as our budget pick and lack extra features like a companion app to tweak your audio experience. They also fit a little small, which may make them uncomfortable to wear if you have a bigger head. However, they're still worth checking out, thanks to their lightweight fit and memory foam padding, keeping fatigue at bay during long gaming sessions. Plus, they last for nearly 20 hours off a single charge, so you can last several matches without a recharge.See our reviewIf you game in noisy environments, you'll want to check out the Razer Barracuda Pro Wireless. Unlike other picks on this list, these headphones have a hybrid casual/gaming design with features that are the best of both worlds. Thanks to their active noise cancelation (ANC) feature, they can block out a great amount of sound, like traffic from an open window and ambient chatter, so you can focus on your audio. With their ANC on, they last over 34 hours continuously.While they have a wireless USB dongle if you want to game on PC and PlayStation consoles with fairly low latency, they also support Bluetooth, so you can game on your Nintendo Switch or mobile device. Although they're not as well-built as the similarly-priced Logitech G PRO X 2 LIGHTSPEED Wireless, they fit more comfortably. They also have a neutral sound with a touch of extra bass to help emphasize sound effects in gameplay.When connected to specific devices, you can access either their PC or smartphone app, and both offer a graphic EQ and presets to help you finetune their sound. For more customization, they support THX Spatial Audio, a virtual soundstage feature that can help immerse you in your audio. That said, they only have an integrated mic, and while it can capture your voice clearly, it has trouble separating speech from loud background noise, which isn't as suitable for multi-player games.See our review  Oct 27, 2023:                 Product picks remain the best for their categories. No changes.                 Sep 27, 2023:                 No pick changes. Minor text updates for clarity.                 Aug 28, 2023:                 We've checked our picks for accuracy and product availability. However, there hasn't been a change in our recommendations.                 Aug 02, 2023:                 We've replaced the Astro A30 Wireless with the Logitech G PRO X 2 LIGHTSPEED Wireless as the Logitech have a more neutral sound profile, which some users may prefer, and are more comfortable. We've also removed the first-gen Logitech G PRO X WIRELESS LIGHTSPEED Gaming Headset from Notable Mentions.                 Jul 04, 2023:                 We've validated that these picks are still the best gaming headsets for their respective categories.               Our recommendations above are what we think are currently the best gaming headsets with a wireless design to buy for most people in each price range. We factor in the price (cheaper headphones win over pricier ones if the difference isn't worth it), feedback from our visitors, and availability (no headphones that are difficult to find or almost out of stock everywhere).If you would like to choose for yourself, here is the list of all our reviews for wireless headphones, ranked by their suitability for wireless gaming. Be careful not to get caught up in the details. There are no perfect headphones, and your personal taste, gaming preference, and playing style will matter more in your selection.Many avid gamers like to enhance their gaming experience by using headphones, and there are already a variety of headphones on the market that are compatible with PlayStation consoles. You may be looking for a wireless headset if you game from your couch and don't want a tangled cord in your lap. On the other hand, wired headphones may be more suitable if you don't want to worry about running out of battery. With so many gaming-oriented headphones on the market, you can also find options with additional features, like sound customization, microphone level adjustments, and virtual surround sound features. Any good pair of gaming headphones should have a comfortable fit and accurately localize objects like footsteps in the stereo image.We've tested over 740 headphones, and below, you'll find our recommendations for the best headsets for PS5 to buy. You can also check out our picks for the best gaming headsets, the best PS4 headsets, and the best Xbox Series X headsets.The Audeze Maxwell Wireless is the best PS5 headset we've tested. These over-ears come in a PlayStation variant and offer a premium gaming experience thanks to their planar-magnetic drivers. These allow for a deeper bass extension, less distortion, and a better soundstage when compared to dynamic driver headphones, like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro. While this makes them a little bulky and heavy for long gaming sessions, their nearly 78-hour battery can get you through many sessions without recharging.These gaming headphones have a neutral sound profile on their default setting. The bass range delivers adequate thump and punch to make sound effects like explosions and gunfire immersive without overpowering the mix. If you want to change the mix, you can use the Audeze HQ app to switch between EQ presets, like the 'Immersive' preset, which makes the sound profile even flatter and better suited for high-res audio. Plus, your voice sounds very clear and natural via the boom mic, and voices from teammates sound detailed and understandable, so you won't miss a thing during an intense game. Unfortunately, these headphones are on backorder, so you may have trouble getting a pair.See our reviewThe best headset for PS5 in the upper mid-range price is the Logitech G PRO X 2 LIGHTSPEED Wireless. These headphones are an updated version of the Logitech G PRO X WIRELESS LIGHTSPEED Gaming Headset and offer a better build quality, with more range of motion for the earcups. They offer low latency, a comfortable fit, and nearly 100 hours of continuous battery life, so you don't need to worry about recharging daily. These headphones also support Bluetooth, so they can pair with your phone or Bluetooth-enabled computer. However, unlike the Audeze Maxwell Wireless, they can only connect with one source simultaneously, so you can't hear audio from your console and phone simultaneously.They have a detachable boom mic that makes your voice sound clear and understandable, though robotic and bassy. Fortunately, it'll prevent your voice from being drowned out by background chit-chat or a passing car. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro cost around the same and have a mic that makes your voice sound more natural. However, it doesn't perform as well in noisy environments, and the headphones aren't quite as comfortable for most people.See our reviewIf you want a more middle-of-the-road option, consider the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Wireless. Their lower price means they aren't quite as comfortable and premium-feeling as the Logitech G PRO X 2 LIGHTSPEED Wireless, but don't let this deter you! They have a similarly bass-rich sound, and thanks to their companion software with a parametric EQ, you can fine-tune them to your liking. Unlike our previous pick, you can transfer the EQ settings directly to your SteelSeries headset, meaning they can work on your console without changing the mix.When connected to a PS5, you can also use PlayStation's Tempest 3D AudioTech, which is meant to help situate sound effects like footsteps properly in the soundstage. They come in console-locked variants, so get the 7P variant for the best performance with PlayStation consoles. We tested the 7X variant, which provides a low latency connection with consoles, and we expect the 7P variant to perform similarly. Their roughly 30-hour continuous battery life can last through long gaming sessions, and they have an auto-off timer to save power when they're not in use. You can also use them wired with most consoles to avoid latency and battery drain altogether.See our reviewFor PS5 gamers wanting to stick within a budget, the Logitech G535 LIGHTSPEED Wireless are the best headphones for PS5 that we've tested. Unlike the pricier options on this list, you can't use these headphones wired. They also don't support Bluetooth but come with a USB dongle that provides a low-latency connection via non-Bluetooth wireless. Their well-balanced sound adds a touch of extra boom to mixes without drowning out dialogue and instruments. That said, while they have companion software, you can't directly access it when using it on a console. On the upside, you can still use the PS5's Tempest 3D AudioTech for a more immersive audio experience.They're decently well-built and have a comfortable fit as well. They last for around 35 hours of continuous use off of a single charge, and even though they don't support an analog connection, they can receive audio while charging. However, the mic makes your voice sound thin compared to previous picks, including the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7, which will affect you if you play multiplayer games.See our reviewHere's a cheaper, more bare-bones option if you're looking for a basic headset. The Logitech G432 are wired headphones designed primarily for PCs, but they're still PS5-compatible by plugging them into a controller or with the USB dongle for low latency wireless gaming. They offer a comfortable fit and a good overall mic performance that outperforms the more expensive Logitech G535 LIGHTSPEED, so your voice sounds clear during online games, even with some noise in the background. Unfortunately, they have a cheap, plasticky build quality that doesn't feel solid.Their sound profile is reasonably well-balanced. They can't reproduce as much rumble and thump from the low-bass range as the Logitech G535 LIGHTSPEED Wireless, but the audio still sounds warm and full. Elements like voices in dialogue also sound clear, though a little veiled. Their companion app lets you adjust the mix with a graphic EQ and presets, but the headphones won't save these settings when you disconnect them from your PC. As such, you're stuck with their default sound profile when using them on PS5.See our reviewThe Drop + Sennheiser/EPOS PC38X are the best headphones for PS5 with an open-back design that we've tested. They're priced in the mid-range, like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Wireless, but offer different advantages and drawbacks. Open-back headphones are only suitable for use in quiet spaces since they don't block out ambient sound and leak a lot of noise. However, if you like to immerse yourself in your game's audio, their open-back design helps create a wider and more open soundstage.Their sound lacks low bass, like most open-back headphones, but there's a touch of extra boom to help bring out sound effects like footsteps in games, while voices and dialogue reproduce clearly and accurately. Unfortunately, unlike most other headsets on our list, it doesn't have a companion app or sound customization features, like an EQ or presets. Fortunately, they're well-built, very comfortable, and include a choice of velour or microfiber ear cup pads. The boom mic makes your voice sound clear and natural, even if you're playing in a moderately noisy environment.See our review  Oct 03, 2023:                 We've validated our picks to ensure that they're still up-to-date and accurate.                 Sep 05, 2023:                 Minor text edits for clarity. No changes in product picks.                 Aug 08, 2023:                 Verified this list's picks and confirmed that they're still the best headsets for PS5 in their respective categories. Minor text changes were also made for clarity and accuracy.                 Jul 11, 2023:                 Replaced the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro with the newly-reviewed Logitech G PRO X 2 LIGHTSPEED Wireless as the 'Best Upper Mid-Range' pick.                 Jun 07, 2023:                 We've added the Turtle Beach Stealth Pro Wireless to the Notable Mentions as they're a competitor to the Audeze Maxwell Wireless, but have drawbacks.               Our recommendations above are what we think are currently the best wired and best wireless headsets for PS5 to buy for most people in each price range. We factor in the price (cheaper headphones win over pricier ones if the difference isn't worth it), feedback from our visitors, and availability (no headphones that are difficult to find or almost out of stock everywhere).If you would like to choose for yourself, here is the list of all our headphones reviews, sorted by their wireless gaming performance. Be careful not to get caught up in the details. There are no perfect headphones. Personal taste, preference, and listening habits will matter more in your selection, especially if you don't care about having a microphone or wireless features.Over-ear headphones, also called around-ear headphones, are among the most popular types. While they can be a little bulky and don't breathe as well as in- or on-ears, most people find them the most comfortable headphones for extended listening periods. They often have more features than many in-ear or earbud options and have longer batteries than their smaller, more portable counterparts.We've tested over 365 pairs of over-ear headphones, and below are our recommendations for the best over-ear headphones to purchase. Also, make sure to check out our recommendations for the best on-ear headphones, the best earbuds and in-ear headphones, and the best Bluetooth over-ear headphones.The Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless are the best over-ear headphones we've tested. They're an older version of the Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless but offer better performance for the price. These headphones have an outstanding active noise cancelling (ANC) system that can isolate you from a wide range of ambient noise. Their bass-heavy sound profile also adds thump, rumble, and punch to your audio, making these headphones well-suited for bass-heavy genres. While that can make mixes sound muddy, you can customize their sound with a graphic EQ and presets in the companion app.These headphones have a premium build quality, a sleek design, and a very comfortable fit. Their roughly 37 hours of continuous playback time will easily last through long days on the go. They also support multi-device pairing, which is convenient if you often switch between your phone and computer. However, they may not be the best choice if you want a good microphone performance for phone calls since, compared to some of the cheaper options listed here, the mic makes your voice sound muffled and lacking in detail.See our reviewThe Bose QuietComfort 45/QC45 Wireless are often compared to the Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless but lack many of their competitor's extra features, like a virtual soundstage, button mapping, and NFC pairing, so they aren't as customizable or easy to pair. Fortunately, they have an excellent noise cancelling performance that easily blocks out sounds like plane engines and ambient chatter. With their ANC on, they also last over 21 hours continuously and are equipped with an auto-off timer to help conserve battery life if you forget to turn them off.Out of the box, their fairly neutral sound is versatile enough for most genres and types of content. Using their companion app's graphic EQ or presets, you can tweak them to suit your tastes. They also support multi-device pairing, meaning you can stay connected to your smartphone and PC simultaneously. They have a plasticky design, though. It helps them remain lightweight and comfortable enough for long listening sessions, but they still feel cheap at this price point.See our reviewThe Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless are a great mid-range pick. These headphones have an adaptive ANC system and a slightly better ANC performance than the Bose QuietComfort 45/QC45 Wireless. It adjusts to your surroundings, blocking out loud vehicle engines and other people's conversations on your commute and at the office. They're pretty comfortable for most people, but their plastic frame can put pressure on the top of your head after a while. Their onboard controls aren't as easy to use, either.Still, these headphones have a great sound suitable for many different genres. The V-shaped sound profile emphasizes the bass and the treble for a punchy, sparkling sound. There's even a graphic EQ and presets in their companion app to fine-tune their sound to your liking. Unfortunately, these headphones have a high noise floor when the ANC is set to 'Adaptive' or 'Max' mode, which can result in an audible frequency that's persistent throughout your listening experience. If you can learn to ignore it, you'll enjoy around 28 hours of continuous battery life with their ANC on. It's less than the manufacturer's advertised 50-hour battery, but it's still excellent for wireless noise cancelling headphones.See our reviewThe Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Wireless are the previous generation of the Anker Soundcore Life Q35 Wireless. They're a great budget pick with a mostly unchanged design from their predecessor, meaning you can expect the same comfortable fit for an affordable price. If you plan to use them on the go, you'll be happy to know that their multi-setting ANC feature performs nearly as well as our previous pick, the Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless. That said, you need to manually switch between the Q30's ANC settings, which isn't as convenient as the Q45's adaptive ANC system.These headphones also have a V-shaped sound profile that packs extra bass while vocals and lead instruments sound bright. You can tune their sound to suit your preferences using their companion app's graphic EQ and presets. Unfortunately, there's a difference in sound quality depending on if the ANC is on or off. They also aren't very breathable, and some users have noticed their unit's headband break or crack over time. Still, they're worth a look if you're shopping on a budget.Check out our article on the best budget and cheap headphones for more budget-friendly options.See our reviewIf you're looking for wireless over-ears and don't want to compromise on sound quality, the Focal Bathys Wireless offer the best of both worlds. These headphones are suitable for both casual use and critical listening, with a default sound that's rich in bass to bring out the thump and punch in your audio. Astute audiophiles will notice that instruments and vocals are slightly veiled, but you can make up for this using the graphic EQ and presets in their companion app. These headphones also support aptX-Adaptive codec for hi-res streaming with compatible apps, like Tidal. They even have an optional wired USB-DAC connection that converts digital audio signals to analog, ensuring a smoother sound with better audio fidelity.However, there are a few drawbacks for either type of user. For audiophiles, their closed-back design means they won't create a wide and spacious soundstage as you would get with traditional open-back hi-fi headphones. On the other hand, if you listen to music while on the go, these headphones are bulkier, and their ANC doesn't cut out as much low-end background noise as the Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless. If none of this bothers you, they're still comfortable, well-built headphones worth a look.See our reviewIf you want headphones to truly upgrade your listening experience, the Sennheiser HD 800 S are the best audiophile over-ear headphones we've tested. They have a premium build quality and a very comfortable fit but differ from the previous picks as they have an open-back design that allows audio to leave the ear cup and interact with the space around you. The result is a wide, spacious, and out-of-head passive soundstage to help immerse you in your audio. They aren't designed for use outside your home or studio since they can't isolate you from ambient sound and leak a lot of audio.They have a very neutral sound profile and can accurately reproduce vocals and lead instruments. They suit most genres, but their open-back design lacks some rumble and punch in the bass range. The equally high-end HiFiMan Arya feature planar-magnetic drivers that deliver much more low-bass, but these headphones are much bulkier than the Sennheiser. They may feel less comfortable if you prefer a lighter set of cans.That said, this range of headphones isn't for everyone, as their high price point puts them well out of reach of more casual users, and you still need to invest in a good amp to power them if you don't already have it. Check out our article on the best audiophile headphones for hi-fi options to suit every budget.See our review  Oct 17, 2023:                 Added the recently-reviewed Bose QuietComfort Headphones Wireless to Notable Mentions.

We factor in the price (cheaper headphones win over pricier ones if the difference isn't worth it), feedback from our visitors, and availability (no headphones that are difficult to find or almost out of stock everywhere).If you would like to choose for yourself, here is the list of all our reviews for over-ear headphones. Be careful not to get caught up in the details. There are no perfect headphones. Personal taste, preference, and listening habits will matter more in your selection. The Audeze Maxwell Wireless are feature-packed gaming headphones that come in Xbox and PlayStation variants. They have a detachable boom mic as well as an integrated mic, support LDAC codec for streaming Hi-Res audio, and you can pair them with two different devices in many ways. However, what sets them apart from competitors like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless For Xbox, are their planar magnetic drivers, which help them reproduce a more extended bass, create a more immersive soundstage, and keep distortion low compared to more common dynamic drivers. This kind of driver is pretty heavy and can be fatiguing to wear over time. Planar magnetics are also more complex and harder to match; our model's L/R drivers have some phase mismatch, affecting the placement of objects in the stereo image. Update 05/03/2023: We have concluded our investigation into our Audeze Maxwell measurements and have updated our results. For more detail, please check out our article here.

For more detail, please check out our article here.The Audeze Maxwell are very good for neutral sound. Out of the box, their default 'Audeze' EQ has a very neutral sound, ensuring adequate punch, thump, and boom, while vocals and instruments sound clear and natural. They have EQ presets available in their companion app, and the 'Immersive' EQ is even flatter and more neutral. These headphones also support LDAC, which is great if you want to stream Hi-Res audio via Bluetooth. Unfortunately, they're closed-back headphones, so their soundstage isn't very immersive or spacious.The Audeze Maxwell are gaming headphones, and while you can make them look more casual by detaching their boom mic, they're still heavy and bulky, which can be a deal breaker if you want to use them for commuting. They also don't block out much of the low rumble of bus and plane engines, and their fit can become fatiguing over time. That said, they have a very long battery life to last through long days on the go.The Audeze Maxwell are gaming headphones and aren't the best choice for sports and fitness. They're heavy, bulky, and can easily fall off your head with moderate movement. On the upside, you can detach the boom mic to help minimize their gamer-centric design.The Audeze Maxwell are decent for office use if you don't mind the heavy, gamer-centric design. They have over 70 hours of continuous playback time and can be paired with your PC and smartphone simultaneously via several different connectivity options. While they lack noise cancelling, they can block out some mid-range noise like ambient chatter and a lot of high-pitched noise like the hum of AC fans. That said, their fit can be fatiguing to wear for long periods.The Audeze Maxwell are very good for wireless gaming. They come in Xbox and PlayStation variants, so it's important to ensure you get the right model for your needs. Their wireless dongle ensures low latency, so your audio and visuals stay in sync while gaming. They have a fairly neutral sound out of the box, but you can also use their companion software's EQ presets to adjust their sound to suit your tastes. If you like to game with others, their boom mic ensures your voice sounds clear and accurate, even if you're talking in noisy environments. You can pair the headphones with your console and smartphone simultaneously too.The Audeze Maxwell are very good for wired gaming. You can use either variant of these headphones via analog or wired USB on PCs, but if you're gaming on console, it's better to stick to the model specific to that console system. Otherwise, you may encounter issues getting controls to work. In addition, there's some feedback present when using the analog cable, and the mic can pick it up, which is a little disappointing. On the upside, the headphones have a neutral sound that most users will enjoy, and their boom mic offers a great overall performance, ensuring you're heard clearly, even in noisy environments.The Audeze Maxwell are very good for phone calls. Using their boom mic, your voice sounds clear and natural, even if you're calling from a noisy environment like a busy street. These headphones also have an integrated mic for a more casual look, and although it doesn't perform as well as the boom mic, your voice is still intelligible to others on the line. It has some trouble separating speech from noise, so if you want to use this mic to take calls, it's best to do so from a quieter environment. These over-ears also lack noise cancelling and have a hard time reducing ambient sound around you. The Audeze Maxwell come in two console-locked variants: 'Xbox' and 'PlayStation'. We tested the 'Xbox' variant. Both variants come in the 'Black' colorway. There's also an 'Ultraviolet Edition' that's designed for Xbox, released August 15th, 2023. This model has a glossy electroplated color scheme that transitions from blue to pink. Since it's only a cosmetic change, we expect our results to also be valid for this variant. If you encounter another variant of these headphones, please let us know in the discussions. The Audeze Maxwell come in two console-locked variants: 'Xbox' and 'PlayStation'. We tested the 'Xbox' variant. Both variants come in the 'Black' colorway. There's also an 'Ultraviolet Edition' that's designed for Xbox, released August 15th, 2023.

The Audeze Maxwell are premium planar magnetic headphones that come in PlayStation and Xbox variants. Like the Audeze Penrose Wireless and Audeze Mobius, they're equipped with a boom mic as well as an integrated mic to suit your usage. They also have a pretty neutral sound out of the box, and there are EQ presets available in their companion app to help you get the best sound. They're pretty heavy compared to other gaming headphones, which can be a drawback during long gaming sessions. They're not as customizable as the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless for Xbox or the Astro A50 Gen 4 Wireless 2019 either, but they offer robust connectivity options and have an exceptionally long continuous playback time.

The Audeze can be used via analog and wired USB and wirelessly with full audio and mic compatibility. They also support codecs like LC3, LC3+, and LDAC, which is great if you like to listen to high-quality audio. Overall, they have a flatter, more neutral sound profile, which some users may prefer compared to the boomy, bassy sound of the Turtle Beach. They have a better, more immersive passive soundstage, too, their boom mic offers a superior overall performance, and they have a significantly longer continuous playback time. They also have lower non-Bluetooth wireless latency, ensuring your audio and visuals are in sync. Latency varies depending on your setup; even though we noticed some audio lag when using the Turtle Beach on PC, which could hinder your gameplay, we didn't notice it via console. The Turtle Beach are also more comfortable since they weigh less and have ANC, which is handy if you want to block out background noise.

However, the Logitech are more comfortable, and their app offers more customization features.The Audeze Maxwell are much more understated in design than the Audeze Penrose Wireless and Audeze Mobius, with mostly black satin design. They have a removable boom mic as well as an integrated mic to help them transition into more casual environments. Although these headphones come in either an 'Xbox' or 'PlayStation' variant, both models have the same black design.These headphones are decently comfortable. They have ear cups that are spacious and well-padded. However, their planar magnetic drivers are heavy, which adds to their total weight. As a result, they're heavier than the Audeze Penrose Wireless and dynamic gaming headsets like the Logitech G PRO X 2 LIGHTSPEED Wireless. The manufacturer offsets the weight by switching from a more traditional headband to a leather ski-band design, which helps distribute the weight more evenly on your head. The headband has three different settings, but if you're between sizes, it can be hard to get the right fit. While you can adjust it by moving only one band on either side of the ear cups, this could also disrupt the seal of the headphones. Unfortunately, even with the ski-band headband, the headphones can cause fatigue over time.The Audeze Maxwell have good physical controls. They're located on the left ear cup and are easy to use. There are voice prompts as well as chimes to let you know when you're changing settings. There's also an LED indicator light to let you know whether you're connected via dongle or Bluetooth, in pairing mode, and the status of the battery. That said, the volume and game chat wheels feel the same, and it can be hard to tell them apart when you're wearing them. Mic mute: Slide up and down: Mutes and unmutes the mic. AI Noise Reduction button: Single press: Turns the mic's noise reduction on and off. Volume wheel: Scroll up or down: Raises or lowers the volume. Single press + scroll up or down: Skips or returns to the previous track. Double press: Cycles through EQ presets. Game chat wheel: Scroll up or down: Adjusts the game/chat mix. Single press + scroll up or down: Adjusts the sidetone. Double press: Turns sidetone on and off.The Audeze Maxwell have good physical controls.

Their ear cups can swivel to lay flat to help reduce their footprint, but they still take up space in your bag. They also lack a carrying case to protect the headphones when on the go.The Audeze Maxwell's build quality is great. These premium over-ears are made of a combination of materials and feel more sturdy than the Audeze Penrose Wireless and Audeze Mobius. The faux leather ear cups are spacious, deep, and detachable. The headband frame is also reinforced with metal, while the headband is made from leather. That said, each time you readjust the headband, it leaves behind leathery residue, and there are only three adjustment levels, which can make it harder to get a good fit. That said, this design isn't meant to be adjusted over and over again, and once you get a good fit, you won't have to adjust it again.These headphones aren't the most stable; although they have a high clamping force, they weigh a lot. However, they'll stay in place if you're gaming at your desk or computer. If you want to use them while moving, they can easily fall off your head, even with moderate head movements. Audeze Maxwell headphones 1/8" TRRS cable USB-C to USB-C cable USB-C dongle USB-C to USB-A adapter Detachable boom mic with filter Manuals Using the 'Audeze' EQ, which is the default setting, the Audeze Maxwell have a neutral sound profile, making them well-suited for most uses. Sound effects like explosions and gunfire are present, while dialogue and instruments are clear, natural, and accurate. That said, if you prefer a different sound, their companion app offers a graphic EQ and presets to help you customize their sound to your liking.If you're looking for an even more neutral sound, then you'll want to check out their 'Immersive' EQ's Sound Profile and Raw Frequency Response. This EQ helps level the bass and treble amount even further, which some users may prefer.Using the 'Audeze' EQ, which is the default setting, the Audeze Maxwell have a neutral sound profile, making them well-suited for most uses.

This EQ helps level the bass and treble amount even further, which some users may prefer.The frequency response consistency is mediocre. The leather headband has a limited range of adjustment due to it only having three levels, making it difficult to get a good fit during our human passes. As a result, we had to adjust one side to be smaller than the other side to achieve a proper fitting. Overall, these headphones are prone to inconsistencies in bass and treble delivery. You may also notice a drop in bass if you have thick hair or wear glasses.The bass accuracy is outstanding. Although they're light on thump and rumble, the rest of the range is fairly flat and even, ensuring that sound effects like footsteps or weaponry clinking in Bayonetta 3 are clear and present in your gameplay.These headphones have fantastic mid accuracy. This range is very flat and neutral, so dialogue between characters and instruments in the soundtrack of the finale of Final Fantasy VII: Remake sound clear, natural, and accurate.The treble accuracy is great. The range is a little underemphasized, so dialogue and instruments are a little veiled, while sibilants are dull. However, this roll-off is somewhat minor.The Auzede Maxwell's peaks and dips performance is great. Overall, there aren't many significant peaks and dips. A small peak in the low-bass adds thump and rumble to the mix, while another between the high-mid to low-treble makes dialogue and instruments bright. The uneven mid-treble turns sibilants alternatingly dull and piercing.Planar magnetic drivers such as those used in these headphones differ from more commonly found dynamic drivers. Their design is more complex, making them more prone to L/R driver mismatch than dynamic drivers, and can have more variance from unit to unit. Audeze usually has good quality control and ergonomics, and our unit's L/R drivers are well-matched in group delay, ensuring tight bass and transparent treble reproduction. They're also well-matched in amplitude and frequency response, ensuring a stable stereo soundstage.However, there's some phase mismatch present, and is audible in subjective listening, as male voices, in particular, sound recessed and incorrectly placed in the soundstage. There's also some rattling and warping in the low-bass, affecting the soundstage's quality. For more information regarding our assessment and retest of phase response, you can check out our investigation article here. It's worth noting that imaging varies between units, but if you have experienced this issue, please let us know in the forums.Planar magnetic drivers such as those used in these headphones differ from more commonly found dynamic drivers.

It's worth noting that imaging varies between units, but if you have experienced this issue, please let us know in the forums.The Audeze Maxwell's passive soundstage is sub-par, mostly due to their closed-back design. Their soundstage doesn't feel very spacious or immersive compared to open-backs like the Drop + Sennheiser PC38X, and they struggle to create an open, out-of-head listening experience. However, their soundstage feels more spacious and wide than the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless for Xbox. It's likely in part due to their planar magnetic drivers, which can create a broader wave front than dynamic drivers to create a better representation of the stereo image.The Xbox variant comes with a Dolby Atmos subscription included in the box, which works on Xbox and PC. This feature offers EQ presets with their own spatial settings to help create a more immersive gaming experience. If you have the PlayStation variant, unfortunately, this subscription has to be bought separately.The Audeze Maxwell's weighted harmonic distortion performance is good. There's some distortion present, noticeably in the right driver's low-bass and in both drivers in the mid-treble range at moderate volumes. Both peaks are narrow and can be hard to hear with real-life content. The rest of the frequencies fall within good limits, which results in mostly clear and pure audio reproduction.These are the settings used to test these headphones. Our results are only valid when used in this configuration.The noise isolation performance is disappointing, but these headphones aren't designed to block out a lot of sound. They won't reduce any of the low rumbles of traffic from an open window. That said, they can reduce some ambient chatter and do a significantly better job of cutting down the high-pitch whirl of computer fans. If you're looking for gaming headphones with a better noise isolation performance and with ANC, check out the Turtle Beach Stealth Pro Wireless PS/Xbox instead.The leakage performance is decent. Leakage is mostly spread in the mid range and sounds somewhat full. If you like to crank up the volume while gaming, others around you will hear it in a quiet space like a living room. It isn't so noticeable in noisier places, though.This headset has two mics: a detachable boom mic and an integrated mic. The detachable boom mic is quite flexible, but if you need to adjust it, it's best to do so from its base as the mic can easily fall down.The boom mic has good recording quality. Your voice sounds very clear, making the mic a solid choice if you like to game with others.The integrated mic also captures your voice very clearly, and you can hear this mic's recorded speech file here. Whoever's on the other end of the line will hear you well.The boom mic has good recording quality.

Whoever's on the other end of the line will hear you well.The boom mic's noise handling performance is outstanding. You'll be heard clearly whether you're talking in a noisy environment like a gaming tournament or chatting with friends at home.The integrated mic doesn't perform quite as well as the boom mic, especially with loud noise like a subway. You can hear our recordings of 'Speech + Pink Noise' and 'Speech + Subway Noise'. Your voice is drowned out by loud sound, so if you want to take a call using the integrated mic, it's best to do so from a quieter environment.The boom mic's noise handling performance is outstanding.

Your voice is drowned out by loud sound, so if you want to take a call using the integrated mic, it's best to do so from a quieter environment.The Audeze Maxwell have outstanding battery performance. The manufacturer advertises them to last 80 hours at 80dB, and we measured a similar amount, which means you can game multiple days in a row without recharging them. Battery life depends on usage and volume, though. Luckily, they have an auto-off timer to help conserve battery life when not in use. The manufacturer also advertises them to deliver 20-30 hours of play time after charging for 20 minutes.The Audeze HQ app is decent. You can also see a video of how it works here. Unlike most gaming companion software, you can use it on mobile devices as well as on PCs. Both pieces of software offer the same level of controls and features, too. There are a few EQ presets for you to choose from, but you can also access the game/chat mixers, toggle the sidetone on/off, and adjust the sidetone's level.The Audeze Maxwell have excellent Bluetooth connectivity. They support Bluetooth version 5.3 and you can connect these headphones with up to two devices in the following ways: via two Bluetooth devices; a device connected via Bluetooth and another connected via dongle; USB wired and Bluetooth (simultaneously); and analog and Bluetooth (simultaneously). You'll need to manually switch audio between devices for any connection that isn't simultaneous, as you can't play audio at the same time. The headphones will also prioritize the output path and automatically switch to Bluetooth (HFP), dongle, Bluetooth (A2DP), USB-C, or analog, depending on the connection.These headphones support Bluetooth LE Audio, which is a wireless standard that's designed with low power consumption in mind. This wireless standard also supports LC3 and LC3+ codecs, both of which offer more efficient audio transmission with higher audio quality. However, we're not currently able to adequately test these codecs. They also support LDAC codec, which is a proprietary codec from Sony for streaming Hi-Res content. This codec has high latency but isn't designed for streaming video and won't be noticeable if you're only listening to audio. That said, these headphones have high latency via SBC on PCs, so this connection may not be the best if you want to game via Bluetooth. Their latency is lower on mobile devices, ensuring your audio and visuals stay in sync. Some apps and devices compensate for latency.The Audeze Maxwell have excellent Bluetooth connectivity.

Some apps and devices compensate for latency.These headphones have excellent non-Bluetooth wireless connectivity. On our first pass, we noticed higher-than-expected latency using the dongle as we measured ~85 ms consistently across three passes. However, the manufacturer claims the results should be closer to 20 ms. Using the same PC but plugging and replugging the dongle into the same port resulted in an average of 34 ms across ten new passes. It's more representative of user experience and day-to-day performance. You can also see how latency varies across PCs when using the Audeze Maxwell and the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Wireless here.In addition to our retest, we tried measuring the latency using 'Audacity' software, resulting in 96 ms of latency, which is higher than our original results of 85 ms. We also noticed that our latency results fluctuated depending on the PC we were connected to and even if we unplugged and replugged the dongle into the same USB port. Following Audacity, we used ASIO4ALL. We were able to get results closer to what the manufacturer advertises, but plugging and replugging in the dongle once again resulted in a variety of values.These headphones have excellent non-Bluetooth wireless connectivity.

The USB-C cable has fairly low latency, ensuring your audio and visuals stay in sync while gaming.Just like with non-Bluetooth wireless latency, wired USB latency can also vary. While we originally measured 43 ms of latency, we retested the latency ten times, unplugging and replugging the USB into the same port. You can see a comparison of all our wired USB passes here. Note that while were able to get lower results, there's still some variation present across passes.These headphones come with a 1/8" TRS cable, a USB-C to USB-C audio/charging cable, and a USB-A to USB-C adapter, also for audio and charging.

The manufacturer states in their FAQ section that Xbox variant isn't officially supported on this console, which can result in 'some limitations in volume control and other possible loss of functionality'. They also recommend that you use the correct variant with each console.  We were still able to get our Xbox variant to work with the PS4 and PS5 via analog, non-Bluetooth wireless, and wired USB with full audio and mic compatibility. There's slight static from the drivers when connected via analog, and the mic can pick up the feedback, though. To use the headphones wirelessly, you'll need to set the USB dongle to 'PC mode' for mic and audio to work. However, you lose game/chat mix controls and will be limited in volume control. You can use PS5 Audio Tempest though, which can help make your audio seem more immersive.If you have the PlayStation variant of this console, you can connect these headphones with these consoles in every way with full compatibility. You won't lose out on features, either.The Audeze Maxwell comes in two console-specific variants: Xbox and PlayStation.

While many runners prefer going truly wireless, having a cable between your earbuds can be a benefit when you're working out in the gym. Truly wireless earbuds eliminate the annoying rustling sound you hear when a cable brushes against your shirt, also called microphonics. However, if you're receiving instructions from a coach or simply want to talk with a friend, it's much easier to let your earbuds hang around your neck while not in use.We've tested over 245 wireless earbuds and in-ear headphones, and below are our recommendations for the best Bluetooth earbuds for running and working out. Also, check out our recommendations for the best headphones for working out, the best wireless earbuds under $100, the best neckband headphones, and the best true wireless earbuds.The best earbuds for working out and running we've tested are the Beats Powerbeats Pro Truly Wireless. These high-end buds feature malleable stability hooks to hold them in place during tough reps and are comfortable to wear. They're also certified IPX4 for resistance against minor water exposure like splashes or light rain, making them a solid choice for outdoor running. Their H1 chip allows you to pair them seamlessly with other devices in your Apple ecosystem.Their battery lasts over 11 hours continuously, and their carrying case holds an additional charge. In terms of sound, they deliver adequate bass, while vocals and instruments are clear in mixes. This makes them versatile enough for most audio content, but they lack customization features to fine-tune their sound. They don't block out much background noise either, so if you want to cut down on ambient sound at the gym, try the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) Truly Wireless. Although their fit isn't as stable, and they don't have stability fins or hooks, their noise cancelling (ANC) system can block out an excellent amount of sound around you.See our reviewThe best earbuds for working out and running we've tested are the Jaybird Vista 2 Truly Wireless. These very well-built buds have a sports-oriented design and come with stability fins. Once you find a good fit, they'll stay in your ears even during intense workouts. They have an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance and a case with an IP54 rating, so you can throw it in your gym bag without worrying about damaging your earbuds. Their default sound profile is well-balanced, but fans of bass-heavy music might want more thump and rumble. Luckily, you can use the parametric EQ and presets in their companion app to customize it.They have an ANC feature, but it does a sub-par job of blocking background noise, so these headphones aren't ideal if noise cancelling is the priority. Their over five-hour continuous playback time isn't as long-lasting as the Beats Powerbeats Pro Truly Wireless. On the upside, their carrying case holds an extra two charges if you need it, and they have an auto-off timer to help conserve battery life if you forget to turn them off.See our reviewThe Skullcandy Push Active True Wireless are the best earbuds for running in the mid-range we've tested. Although they aren't as well-built as the Jaybird Vista 2 Truly Wireless, these comfortable buds are rated IP55 for resistance against dust and water exposure, and their ear hook design keeps them in place while you're moving. Their bass-rich sound delivers extra thump, punch, and boom to help keep you motivated all the way through a tough workout. Plus, if you prefer a different sound, their companion app has a graphic EQ and presets so that you can fine-tune their sound to your liking.These buds have 9.5 hours of continuous playback time, and their carrying case has roughly 3.4 additional charges. While they don't have ANC, they can block out an acceptable amount of ambient sound. These buds also support Skull-iQ, which offer voice command support if you don't want to use their physical controls.See our reviewIf you're on a budget, the best earbuds for running we've tested are the Beats Flex Wireless. Although they don't have ear hooks like the Skullcandy Push Active True Wireless and aren't as stable in-ear, they have a neck cable design, so you can wear them around your neck when not in use. They also last 11 hours continuously, which is longer than other picks on this list, and come in a variety of colors to match your style. They have a W1 chip, so you can seamlessly connect to other devices in your Apple ecosystem.These comfortable buds have a bass-heavy sound, which can help keep you pumped up while running. They lack sound customization features and an IP rating for water resistance. Although they don't have noise cancelling, they can still block out a decent amount of ambient sound, like pedestrians talking if you're running outdoors.See our reviewIf you're looking for something that won't break the bank, the JLab Audio GO Air POP True Wireless are the best cheap earbuds for running that we've tested. They have a sturdy design and come in a few different colors to suit your style. Unlike the Beats Flex Wireless, they're also rated IPX4 for resistance to minor water exposure, though they aren't as comfortable. Even though they don't have stability fins, once you get a good fit with the included ear tips, they're stable enough to stay in place during runs. Their nine-hour battery life will last through several workouts without a recharge, and the carrying case stores several extra charges. The charging cable is built into the case, so you'll need to replace the entire unit if it's damaged.These earbuds stand out from other cheap options because even though they don't have an app, you can choose between a few EQ presets using the onboard controls. Using the flattest EQ preset, they have a bass-rich sound that adds rumble, punch, and boom to your audio without overwhelming instruments and lead vocals. Like most of the earbuds on this list, they don't have ANC, so they don't do a great job of blocking out noise, especially bass-range noise like rumbling engines or workout machines at the gym.See our reviewIf your running route takes you along busy roads or paths used by cyclists, you may want to hear what's happening around you. They may push the limits of what earbuds are, but for outdoor runners concerned about safety, the Shokz OpenRun Bone Conduction are a great option. Unlike the previous picks, they sit at your temples and send vibrations through your bones to produce sound. It lets you hear your audio and keeps your ears open to monitor your surroundings.They have a comfortable fit, an IP67 rating for resistance against dust and water immersion, and roughly 13 hours of continuous battery life. Overall, they have a good build quality, although the neckband feels slightly thin and flimsy. They're meant to provide a background soundtrack during exercise and don't reproduce much bass. However, vocals and lead instruments sound clear, making them a solid choice for vocal-centric content like podcasts.However, if you want to hear a little more bass, you might prefer the Shokz OpenFit True Wireless. These aren't bone-conduction headphones—they use small speakers, like most earbuds, but sit outside of your ears. They don't block ambient noise, and audio sounds more punchy and full. You can customize their sound with a graphic EQ in their companion app, unlike the OpenRun. However, they have a shorter continuous battery life and a lower IP54 rating, so you can't immerse them in water.See our reviewYou'll want a great-sounding pair of wireless earbuds even if you're out on a run. The Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Truly Wireless offer a really impressive sound quality suitable for listening to many different music genres, and they're still stable enough in your ears that you can bring them along on your next day in the gym. They come with a couple of different ear tip and fin sleeve options to help you get the best possible fit. With a battery life of over thirteen hours, you don't have to worry about running out of juice during longer runs.These headphones stand out from the crowd thanks to their neutral sound right out of the box. Voices and lead instruments accurately reproduce, and while there's plenty of bass for genres like EDM and hip-hop, it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the mix. The Galaxy Wearable companion app even comes with some EQ presets to switch up its sound, which is a cool touch. Either way, these earbuds are a great option for runners who want the flexibility to wear them in and out of the gym without compromising sound quality.See our review  Oct 20, 2023:                 We've made minor updates to the text and checked that the products are in stock.                 Sep 21, 2023:                 Added the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ as the 'Best-Sounding Earbuds'.                 Aug 23, 2023:                 Added the recently reviewed Shokz OpenFit True Wireless as an alternative to the Shokz OpenRun Bone Conduction in the 'Best For Running Safely' category.                 Jul 27, 2023:                 We've replaced the Anker Soundcore Dot 2 Truly Wireless with the Beats Flex Wireless, as the Beats are more comfortable and have a W1 chip for seamless pairing with Apple devices.                 Jun 30, 2023:                 We've added the Beats Powerbeats Pro Truly Wireless to better reflect what's available at a higher price point and compared them with the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) Truly Wireless. We've also replaced the Jabra Elite 3 True Wireless with the Skullcandy Push Active True Wireless, which have a more stable fit.               Our recommendations above are what we think are currently the best wireless earbuds for running and working out for most people to buy in each price range. We factor in the price (cheaper headphones win over pricier ones if the difference isn't worth it), feedback from our visitors, and availability (no headphones that are difficult to find or almost out of stock everywhere).If you would like to choose for yourself, here is the list of all our reviews for wireless in-ear headphones and earbuds. Be careful not to get caught up in the details. There are no perfect headphones. Personal taste, preference, and where you use the headphones will matter more in your selection.While most people prefer earbuds for sports, many find over-ear headphones more comfortable for light and moderate exercise. Finding the best over-ear headphones for the gym can be hard, though. Most over-ear headphones aren't designed to fit securely enough to stay in place while training and make you sweat more than usual. Regularly working out with them could also result in issues not covered by the manufacturer's warranty, so take extra care if you use them while working out or running. Keep an eye on their performance, and give them lots of time to air out between training sessions. That said, there are still a few Bluetooth options that could be decent for working out or running.We've tested over 370 over-ear headphones, and below are our recommendations for the best over-ear headphones for running and working out. If you want more fitness audio options, check out our recommendations for the best wireless earbuds for running and working out or the best headphones for running.The Beats Studio3 Wireless are the best over-ear headphones for working out that we've tested. These over-ears are a more premium pick, worth a look if you want high-end features like ANC or quick pairing for your next workout. They have good stability, so they won't move around much as you work up a sweat. Plus, they have a W1 chip, which lets you seamlessly pair them with your Apple devices.Their ANC performs decently and will isolate you from the ambient chatter of gym-goers nearby and high-pitched noise like squeaky treadmills. Their physical controls are decent, too, and give you good tactile feedback when changing between songs. However, the controls are completely flush with the body of the ear cup, so there's no way to differentiate between buttons, which can lead to misclicks.Out of the box, they have a warm sound profile with extra bass, making them a solid choice for genres like hip-hop and EDM. However, vocals and instruments are veiled in the mix, and even though they have a companion app, this lacks an EQ for sound customization. If you don't mind their default sound, they'll last you through repeat workouts, thanks to their 23-hour continuous battery life. They even come in several different color schemes to help you find the right one that matches your style.See our reviewIf you're looking for a more affordable pair of over-ears for the gym, check out the Skullcandy Hesh Evo Wireless. There's a big price difference between these cans and our top pick, and they're not quite as comfortable or as durable. Still, if you're looking for headphones that are easier on the wallet to replace if damaged, they're worth a look. They're stable enough for moderate exercise without feeling too tight.Their earpads are deep and decently comfortable but have a faux leather lining prone to trapping heat. Fortunately, their battery lasts around 44 hours on a single charge, so you're likely to get through many workouts before meeting to charge them. While they don't have an ANC feature and struggle to passively cut out background noise, like nearby traffic or chatty gymgoers, this makes them a better value buy, especially if you want to stay aware of your surroundings while you work out.If you want a more durable pair of mid-range over-ears, check out the TREBLAB Z7 Pro Wireless. They're more expensive than the Skullcandy, but they have an IPX4 rating for protection against water splashes—a rarity among over-ear headphones that makes them better-suited for tough workouts and outdoor excursions.See our reviewIf you need something simple and cheap for the gym, the Anker Soundcore Life Q20 Wireless are the best over-ear headphones for running and working out in the budget range. While they're less stable on your head than the Skullcandy Hesh Evo Wireless, they're more comfortable and can stay in place during moderate exercise. Their bass-heavy sound profile also adds a lot of thump and rumble to your audio, which you might like to help keep you pumped up during workouts, but they don't have customization features for people who want a more balanced sound.They have a long 32-hour continuous battery life and decent controls that let you change the volume and skip tracks on the fly. They have an ANC feature but aren't ideal for reducing the sound of workout machines or traffic. Still, they help cut down on mid-range noise like background conversations. Unfortunately, they have a somewhat plasticky build and are prone to damage if they fall off your head during a more intense workout.See our reviewIf your pump-up playlist consists mainly of EDM or hip-hop, you want a pair of headphones that can deliver heavy thump and punch in the bass range. The Sony WH-1000XM4 are the best headphones we've tested for heavy bass delivery. Fortunately, they're also well-suited for use while exercising as they're very comfortable and don't move around during moderate movement. They're well-built and durable enough to survive a few accidental drops on the gym floor.Their battery lasts around 38 hours on a single charge, meaning they'll get you through several workouts without needing to top them up. While their sound is bass-heavy by default, you can change how you'd like the mix to sound by using the companion app's graphic EQ and presets.You can also use their app to activate transparency mode, which allows you to hear your surroundings better while you have these over-ears on. If you'd prefer peace and quiet, you can activate their ANC, which does a fantastic job of cutting out background noise across the range, from low-rumbly bus engines to high-pitched PC fans. They're much more expensive than the Beats Studio3 Wireless, though, and lack their W1 chip for seamless pairing with Apple devices.See our reviewWhat sets the Bose QuietComfort 45/QC45 Wireless apart from other picks on their list is their amazingly comfortable and lightweight fit. Plush padding around the ear cups and on the headband reduces the chances of fatigue if you wear them for a long workout. They'll stay in place while lifting weights or riding a stationary bike, but they aren't as stable as other picks on this list, like the Beats Studio3 Wireless, and can fall off easier during moderate exercise. On the upside, their physical control scheme is easy to use.Like most other Bose headphones, they have an excellent ANC system that can help cut down noise at the gym and an 'Aware Mode' that plays background noise alongside regular audio content for better environmental awareness during a workout outside. With the ANC on, they last over 21 hours continuously, and they have an auto-off timer if you forget to turn them off.Their neutral sound profile is well-suited for different audio content, but you can tweak them using their companion app's graphic EQ and presets. However, they leak audio at high volumes, which may bother others around you. They're also the most expensive pick on this list, and while they have a premium feel and performance, they aren't in everyone's budget for over-ears.See our review  Oct 11, 2023:                 We've made minor changes to the text to improve readability and accuracy. Our picks have stayed the same.                 Sep 15, 2023:                 Added the Beats Studio Pro Wireless to Notable Mentions.                 Aug 17, 2023:                 Removed the Sennheiser PXC 550-II Wireless and the Jabra Elite 85h Wireless from Notable Mentions as they've been discontinued.                 Jul 19, 2023:                 We've checked our picks for accuracy and product availability. However, there hasn't been a change in our recommendations.                 Jun 21, 2023:                 We've validated the article's picks and confirmed that they're still the best picks for this category.               Our recommendations above are what we think are currently the best wireless over-ear headphones for working out to buy for most people in each price range. We factor in the price (cheaper headphones win over pricier ones if the difference isn't worth it), feedback from our visitors, and availability (no headphones that are difficult to find or almost out of stock everywhere).If you would like to choose for yourself, here is the list of all our reviews of over-ear headphones, ranked by their suitability for sports and fitness. Be careful not to get caught up in the details. There are no perfect headphones. Personal taste, preference, and where you use the headphones will matter more in your selection.In this day and age, there's an expectation that you can answer calls quickly and easily. Whether you're working from home and joining a meeting, or if you're getting a call from family on the go, you'll want earbuds with a solid mic performance. If you're taking calls from a noisy office or a busy street, blocking out background noise can make it easier to understand your conversation. This article mostly covers truly wireless earbuds. They don't offer the best performance regarding calls, especially when compared to dedicated earbuds & Bluetooth headsets for phone calls, but they maximize versatility and portability.We've tested over 275 pairs of earbuds and in-ear headphones with microphones, and below are our recommendations for the best earbuds for calls to buy. If you want more recommendations, check out our picks for the best earbuds with a mic. If you don't mind an over-ear fit, you'll also want to check out the best office headphones.The Sony WF-1000XM5 Truly Wireless are the best earbuds for phone calls we've tested. Like most Bluetooth earbuds, they have an integrated mic, and while it doesn't make your voice sound natural or full, you'll be easy to understand. It has decent noise handling, so your voice won't be drowned out by loud background noise like a truck going by or a train pulling into the station. They support multi-device pairing, so you can easily jump from meetings on your computer to a call on your phone. With head gesture controls, you can even answer or end a call by moving your head.These are some of the best earbuds we've tested overall, partly thanks to their outstanding noise isolation performance. If you use the included foam ear tips and activate 'Adaptive Sound Control' in the app, they block out a wide range of noise, so you can hear calls you take on the bus or in a busy office. Their well-balanced sound profile makes voices clear and detailed, and they last for nearly nine hours of continuous use.They're comfortable for most people, but you may find that the foam tips put pressure on your ear canals after a while. If you want a more comfortable option for long days, the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II Truly Wireless are worth considering. Their mic has sub-par noise handling, so they aren't as good for phone calls from noisy places, but it also makes your voice sound a bit more natural and full-bodied. They offer similar noise isolation and a more comfortable fit for most people.See our reviewIf you're looking for a cheaper option, check out the Razer Hammerhead Pro HyperSpeed True Wireless. These less expensive earbuds don't offer the same level of noise isolation as the Sony WF-1000XM5 Truly Wireless, especially with low-pitched noise, like rumbling engines, so they aren't as suitable for calls from noisy places like subway stations. However, they still do a good job of reducing ambient sound so you can hear your call. Their wireless USB-C dongle works with phones and computers (as well as PlayStation consoles), and if you're connected that way, they offer a much better mic recording quality and a stronger noise handling performance, so your voice sounds clear and understandable, even in noisy environments.They have a well-balanced sound profile that makes it easy to understand whoever you're speaking with, and they have onboard controls for answering and ending calls. However, they have a short continuous battery life of roughly five hours. They support Bluetooth when you'd rather not connect with the dongle, but switching between connection types can be a pain. They also don't support multi-device pairing, so you'll have to re-pair them if you need to switch between your phone and computer.See our reviewThe best Bluetooth earbuds for phone calls in the mid-range we've tested are the Nothing Ear (2) Truly Wireless. Although their ANC doesn't perform quite as well as the Razer Hammerhead Pro HyperSpeed True Wireless', they offer a very good mic performance. The integrated mic offers a fairly good recording quality, making your voice understandable over the phone. It almost matches Razer's noise-handling performance, so background noise at the office won't drown out your voice.With the ANC on, they last over five and a half hours, which may not get you through long days without a recharge. Luckily, their carrying case holds four extra charges if needed. Their sound is versatile enough for most kinds of audio content as well. You can answer and end calls with the earbuds' onboard controls. If you're looking for buds with more call-centric features, consider the Jabra Elite 7 Pro True Wireless instead. Their app offers sidetone, which allows you to monitor your voice during a call, and EQ presets that affect how the other person's voice sounds. However, the mic's noise handling is significantly worse.See our reviewShopping on a budget? Then you'll want to check out the TOZO NC7 Truly Wireless, the best wireless earbuds for phone calls at this price point. These earbuds have been in and out of stock at some retailers lately, but you can get them directly from the manufacturer's website if they aren't available. These buds aren't as comfortable as the Nothing Ear (2) Truly Wireless, but they have a good enough mic recording quality for calls.However, they have sub-par mic noise handling, so you'll need to make calls from quieter places to ensure your voice is easily understandable. Their ANC feature blocks out more noise than the Nothing Ear's, which is impressive for budget-friendly buds. They also last over eight hours continuously, which is good for long days at work. Their ANC system makes these buds stand out from other budget-friendly picks. If you want to focus on your call, they can easily reduce noise, like traffic from an open window of office chatter.On the other hand, if you're more concerned about staying aware of your surroundings, you might prefer a mono headset like the Jabra Talk 45 Bluetooth Headset. This headset consists of one earbud with a tiny boom mic, so you can keep one ear free when you're on the phone. It makes your voice sound clear and does a passable job of separating it from background noise. As expected, its sound profile isn't good for music, but voices reproduce accurately. It supports multi-device pairing, and you can set it up to read out your text messages when you can't look at your phone.See our reviewWired earbuds are worth checking out if call quality is your top priority. While they're more unwieldy than their truly wireless counterparts and usually lack useful features like customizability or noise cancelling, they have in-line mics rather than integrated ones. This design puts the mic closer to your mouth, making it easier for the mic to separate speech from background noise. Enter the Apple EarPods. Even though they're a lot older and less refined than other buds on this list, they have a great recording quality. They can also separate speech from ambient noise so you're heard clearly.These budget-friendly buds may not be as well-built as the TOZO NC7 Truly Wireless since their cable is pretty flimsy, but some people may find their one-size-fits-all design more comfortable than an in-ear fit. They also have a well-balanced sound that ensures voices sound clear and natural. They lack low-bass, so they may not be ideal if you want to listen to genres like EDM or hip-hop in your downtime. They also don't block out background noise, so it can be harder to hear your conversation well if you're calling from a noisy office.See our review  Oct 06, 2023:                 We've removed the JBL CLUB PRO+ TWS True Wireless from Notable Mentions as they're no longer available.                 Sep 11, 2023:                 Replaced the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II Truly Wireless with the Sony WF-1000XM5 Truly Wireless as the 'Best Earbuds For Phone Calls'. Also replaced the Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 with the Razer Hammerhead Pro HyperSpeed True Wireless as the upper mid-range pick.                 Jul 14, 2023:                 We've replaced the Jabra Elite 7 Pro True Wireless with the Nothing Ear (2) Truly Wireless as the Nothing have a better overall mic performance.                 May 19, 2023:                 Removed the Sony WI-1000XM2 Wireless and the Jabra Talk 45 Bluetooth Headset. Moved the Sony to Notable Mentions and added the Jabra as an alternative to the budget pick.               Our recommendations above are what we think are currently the best earbuds for calls for most people. We factor in the price (cheaper headphones win over pricier ones if the difference isn't worth it), feedback from our visitors, and availability (no headphones that are difficult to find or almost out of stock everywhere).If you would like to choose for yourself, here is the list of all earbuds, sorted by phone call usage. Be careful not to get caught up in the details. There are no perfect headphones. Personal taste, preference, and listening habits will matter more in your selection.If you care about audio quality above all else, you'll want a good pair of audiophile-level headphones. While these headphones generally aren't the best option for on-the-go use due to their lack of active features, they're great for fully immersing yourself in your music while at home. They reproduce sound accurately, and most can create a spacious, open soundstage that mimics listening to music on actual tower speakers. They also generally feel well-built and comfortable enough to fully enjoy the music without being reminded that you're wearing headphones at all. Due to limitations with the Bluetooth connection, this article primarily focuses on wired audiophile headphones.We've tested over 740 pairs of headphones, and below are our recommendations for the best headphones for audiophiles you can buy. See our recommendations for the best headphones for music, the best bass headphones, the best wired headphones, and the best studio headphones.The best audiophile headphones we've tested are the Sennheiser HD 800 S. These top-of-the-line headphones aren't for everyone; their high price point puts them out of reach for most users, and you'll need a powerful amplifier to drive them, which can be an additional expense. However, if you're looking for an immersive experience regardless of cost, these open-back over-ears have an outstanding soundstage that's large, natural, and spacious. As a result, audio feels like it's coming from out in front of you rather than inside your head.Their dynamic transducers aren't as prone to stereo imaging issues as planar magnetic headphones. The trade-off is that they lack more low-bass. Although they lack a bit of punch and rumble to their sound, these comfortable over-ears have a touch of extra high-bass to add warmth to mixes. Vocals and lead instruments are reproduced accurately thanks to their flat and balanced mids. If you're looking for high-end audiophile headphones with more bass, check out the HiFiMan Arya. They're planar magnetic headphones that deliver more thump and punch to mixes but are brighter than the Sennheiser. Sibilants sound a bit piercing, though, which isn't ideal for everyone.See our reviewThe HiFiMan Edition XS are the best mid-range audiophile headphones we've tested. These over-ears are easier on the wallet than the Sennheiser HD 800 S and still have planar magnetic transducers to help boost their bass and create an immersive sound. While they aren't as comfortable or well-built, they have a neutral sound profile with a flat mid-range, so vocals and lead instruments sound present and clear. They also lack a bit of low-bass but have a bump of high-bass that adds warmth to mixes to balance their sound. Their passive soundstage is outstanding; it feels wide, spacious, and as if your audio is coming from outside your head.These over-ears have a comfortable fit and, unlike other HiFiMan headphones, have a more conventional headband design. However, they still have a large fit. As a result, they aren't as comfortable as our top pick, especially if you have a small head. They're also well-built, but their plasticky hinges make them feel cheap.See our reviewIf you're looking for something under the $500 range, consider the HiFiMan Sundara 2020. Like the HiFiMan Edition XS, they're planar magnetic headphones but have a different overall design, which some users may prefer. Their ski-band headband helps distribute the headphones' weight across your head, and they have a circular ear cup design. They have a higher clamping force, so they fit more snugly. Their passive soundstage doesn't feel as out of head either, though it's still very open and spacious.These over-ears have balanced and neutral mids, ensuring natural, present, and clear vocals and instruments. Sibilants like cymbals are present without becoming overly bright or piercing. While they don't reproduce as much thump and punch as the Edition XS, their touch of extra high-bass helps add warmth to your mix.See our reviewThe Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO are the best lower mid-range headphones for audiophiles we've tested. Like many audiophile headphones on the lower end of the price range, they have a closed-back design. Even though they're comparable to similarly-priced open-backs like the Philips Fidelio X2HR for neutral sound, they don't create a soundstage as wide or spacious as open-backs. However, there are a few upsides to the closed-back design: it allows them to block out some ambient sound, like background chatter, and leak less audio, which is helpful for studio work. Closed-back headphones also do a better job reproducing bass, so your audio has adequate rumble and boom compared to open-backs like the HiFiMan Sundara 2020.Voices and lead instruments are present and accurate, too. The bright treble response can be fatiguing over time, but you may still like this sound, as it can help you hear imperfections while mixing audio. They also have a comfortable, well-built design, but the audio cable isn't detachable, meaning you must replace the headphones if it breaks. If you'd like a replaceable cable, you might prefer the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x, which come with three interchangeable audio cables. They can't block out as much ambient sound, though.See our reviewIf you're looking for even more affordable headphones, the Philips SHP9500 are the best budget audiophile headphones we've tested. These wallet-friendly headphones are plasticky compared to the more expensive options listed here, so they don't feel very durable. Still, they offer a very neutral sound profile, with a flat mid-range response that ensures vocals and lead instruments are clear, accurate, and detailed. Unlike the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO, they have an open-back design that helps to create a wide-seeming and immersive passive soundstage. This design also means they struggle to reproduce low-bass, so your audio lacks thump and rumble.They deliver audio consistently from use to use and have a very comfortable fit, with big ear cups that can easily fit around most people's ears. However, if you're looking for cheaper headphones, consider the Superlux HD 681. They aren't as comfortable as the Philips but offer an analytical sound profile to help bring out imperfections in your audio. If you're concerned about durability, they don't feel as well-built as the Philips.See our reviewIf you prefer an in-ear fit instead of over-ears, the best in-ear monitors (IEMs) we've tested are the MOONDROP Blessing 3. These headphones offer a comfortable and stable fit, so they won't slip out of your ears if you move your head around. Plus, their audio cables loop around your ear for added stability, which is a nice touch. Made of a combination of stainless steel and plastic, these in-ears feel well-built overall. Their cables are detachable, so you can always swap them out if they become damaged.These headphones have a well-balanced sound suitable for lots of different audio content, with a clear and detailed representation of voices and lead instruments in the mix. That said, in-ears create a smaller and less immersive passive soundstage compared to the over-ears on our list. As a result, sound seems to come more from inside your head rather than from all around you. It may be a fair trade-off if you prefer in-ear monitors, especially as their design allows them to block out more ambient sound than closed-back over-ear alternatives like the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO.See our reviewThe best casual-use audiophile headphones we've tested are the Focal Bathys Wireless. These Bluetooth headphones have a closed-back design. Unlike the much cheaper Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO, they have a very good ANC feature, so you can use them on the bus or when you're out for a walk; noise like background chit-chat or rumbling engines won't drown out your music. They're also wireless, so you don't need to worry about managing a long cable when you're out and about. They support the aptX Adaptive codec for high-res audio, which helps improve audio quality via Bluetooth.These headphones have a bass-rich, well-balanced sound, with an EQ and presets in the companion software to help you get the sound you want. Unlike most audiophile headphones, they have a microphone, even if its performance isn't the best. If gaming or mic performance is important, you might prefer the RØDE NTH-100M. While any wired headphones can receive audio from most consoles, these have a detachable boom mic with excellent recording quality and a well-balanced sound profile. However, both the RØDE and the Focal have a closed-back design, and their passive soundstage performances aren't very good. The soundstage seems small, and audio seems to come from inside your head.See our review  Sep 15, 2023:                 No changes in product picks after confirming their accuracy and availability. Some minor text updates for clarity.                 Jul 20, 2023:                 Replaced the MOONDROP Aria with the MOONDROP Blessing 3 as 'Best IEMs'.                 May 23, 2023:                 Replaced the HiFiMan ANANDA-BT Wireless with the Focal Bathys Wireless because the Focal's closed-back design makes them better for casual use. Moved the HiFiMan to Notable Mentions.                 Mar 07, 2023:                 We've replaced the HiFiMan Arya with the HiFiMan Edition XS and added the HiFiMan Sundara 2020 as the 'Best Mid-Range Audiophile Headphones' to better show the gradation of headphones across the price spectrum. Also added the Focal Bathys Wireless to Notable Mentions.                 Jan 05, 2023:                 Made minor text updates and ensured that the products are available.               Our recommendations above are what we think are currently the best sounding headphones to buy for most people in each price range. We factor in the price (cheaper headphones win over pricier ones if the difference isn't worth it), feedback from our visitors, and availability (no headphones that are difficult to find or almost out of stock everywhere).If you would like to choose for yourself, here is the list of all our reviews for headphones, sorted by their neutral sound performance. Be careful not to get caught up in the details. There are no perfect headphones. Personal taste, preference, and where you use the headphones will matter more in your selection.While most people prefer earbuds for sports, many find over-ear headphones more comfortable for light and moderate exercise. Finding the best over-ear headphones for the gym can be hard, though. Most over-ear headphones aren't designed to fit securely enough to stay in place while training and make you sweat more than usual. Regularly working out with them could also result in issues not covered by the manufacturer's warranty, so take extra care if you use them while working out or running. Keep an eye on their performance, and give them lots of time to air out between training sessions. That said, there are still a few Bluetooth options that could be decent for working out or running.We've tested over 370 over-ear headphones, and below are our recommendations for the best over-ear headphones for running and working out. If you want more fitness audio options, check out our recommendations for the best wireless earbuds for running and working out or the best headphones for running.The Beats Studio3 Wireless are the best over-ear headphones for working out that we've tested. These over-ears are a more premium pick, worth a look if you want high-end features like ANC or quick pairing for your next workout. They have good stability, so they won't move around much as you work up a sweat. Plus, they have a W1 chip, which lets you seamlessly pair them with your Apple devices.Their ANC performs decently and will isolate you from the ambient chatter of gym-goers nearby and high-pitched noise like squeaky treadmills. Their physical controls are decent, too, and give you good tactile feedback when changing between songs. However, the controls are completely flush with the body of the ear cup, so there's no way to differentiate between buttons, which can lead to misclicks.Out of the box, they have a warm sound profile with extra bass, making them a solid choice for genres like hip-hop and EDM. However, vocals and instruments are veiled in the mix, and even though they have a companion app, this lacks an EQ for sound customization. If you don't mind their default sound, they'll last you through repeat workouts, thanks to their 23-hour continuous battery life. They even come in several different color schemes to help you find the right one that matches your style.See our reviewIf you're looking for a more affordable pair of over-ears for the gym, check out the Skullcandy Hesh Evo Wireless. There's a big price difference between these cans and our top pick, and they're not quite as comfortable or as durable. Still, if you're looking for headphones that are easier on the wallet to replace if damaged, they're worth a look. They're stable enough for moderate exercise without feeling too tight.Their earpads are deep and decently comfortable but have a faux leather lining prone to trapping heat. Fortunately, their battery lasts around 44 hours on a single charge, so you're likely to get through many workouts before meeting to charge them. While they don't have an ANC feature and struggle to passively cut out background noise, like nearby traffic or chatty gymgoers, this makes them a better value buy, especially if you want to stay aware of your surroundings while you work out.If you want a more durable pair of mid-range over-ears, check out the TREBLAB Z7 Pro Wireless. They're more expensive than the Skullcandy, but they have an IPX4 rating for protection against water splashes—a rarity among over-ear headphones that makes them better-suited for tough workouts and outdoor excursions.See our reviewIf you need something simple and cheap for the gym, the Anker Soundcore Life Q20 Wireless are the best over-ear headphones for running and working out in the budget range. While they're less stable on your head than the Skullcandy Hesh Evo Wireless, they're more comfortable and can stay in place during moderate exercise. Their bass-heavy sound profile also adds a lot of thump and rumble to your audio, which you might like to help keep you pumped up during workouts, but they don't have customization features for people who want a more balanced sound.They have a long 32-hour continuous battery life and decent controls that let you change the volume and skip tracks on the fly. They have an ANC feature but aren't ideal for reducing the sound of workout machines or traffic. Still, they help cut down on mid-range noise like background conversations. Unfortunately, they have a somewhat plasticky build and are prone to damage if they fall off your head during a more intense workout.See our reviewIf your pump-up playlist consists mainly of EDM or hip-hop, you want a pair of headphones that can deliver heavy thump and punch in the bass range. The Sony WH-1000XM4 are the best headphones we've tested for heavy bass delivery. Fortunately, they're also well-suited for use while exercising as they're very comfortable and don't move around during moderate movement. They're well-built and durable enough to survive a few accidental drops on the gym floor.Their battery lasts around 38 hours on a single charge, meaning they'll get you through several workouts without needing to top them up. While their sound is bass-heavy by default, you can change how you'd like the mix to sound by using the companion app's graphic EQ and presets.You can also use their app to activate transparency mode, which allows you to hear your surroundings better while you have these over-ears on. If you'd prefer peace and quiet, you can activate their ANC, which does a fantastic job of cutting out background noise across the range, from low-rumbly bus engines to high-pitched PC fans. They're much more expensive than the Beats Studio3 Wireless, though, and lack their W1 chip for seamless pairing with Apple devices.See our reviewWhat sets the Bose QuietComfort 45/QC45 Wireless apart from other picks on their list is their amazingly comfortable and lightweight fit. Plush padding around the ear cups and on the headband reduces the chances of fatigue if you wear them for a long workout. They'll stay in place while lifting weights or riding a stationary bike, but they aren't as stable as other picks on this list, like the Beats Studio3 Wireless, and can fall off easier during moderate exercise. On the upside, their physical control scheme is easy to use.Like most other Bose headphones, they have an excellent ANC system that can help cut down noise at the gym and an 'Aware Mode' that plays background noise alongside regular audio content for better environmental awareness during a workout outside. With the ANC on, they last over 21 hours continuously, and they have an auto-off timer if you forget to turn them off.Their neutral sound profile is well-suited for different audio content, but you can tweak them using their companion app's graphic EQ and presets. However, they leak audio at high volumes, which may bother others around you. They're also the most expensive pick on this list, and while they have a premium feel and performance, they aren't in everyone's budget for over-ears.See our review  Oct 11, 2023:                 We've made minor changes to the text to improve readability and accuracy. Our picks have stayed the same.                 Sep 15, 2023:                 Added the Beats Studio Pro Wireless to Notable Mentions.                 Aug 17, 2023:                 Removed the Sennheiser PXC 550-II Wireless and the Jabra Elite 85h Wireless from Notable Mentions as they've been discontinued.                 Jul 19, 2023:                 We've checked our picks for accuracy and product availability. However, there hasn't been a change in our recommendations.                 Jun 21, 2023:                 We've validated the article's picks and confirmed that they're still the best picks for this category.               Our recommendations above are what we think are currently the best wireless over-ear headphones for working out to buy for most people in each price range. We factor in the price (cheaper headphones win over pricier ones if the difference isn't worth it), feedback from our visitors, and availability (no headphones that are difficult to find or almost out of stock everywhere).If you would like to choose for yourself, here is the list of all our reviews of over-ear headphones, ranked by their suitability for sports and fitness. Be careful not to get caught up in the details. There are no perfect headphones. Personal taste, preference, and where you use the headphones will matter more in your selection.While it can feel like there's a general trend to move towards wireless headphones, a wired design offers many benefits. A wired connection eliminates audio lag, which is beneficial for studio use, while their analog cable can instantly connect to devices with an AUX input like an amplifier or DAC. Wired headphones work passively, so you don't need to worry about running out of battery. While the gap between wired and wireless headphones is growing smaller and smaller when it comes to audio quality, you may still prefer to use a wired design to ensure you hear all the detail your audio has to offer.We've tested over 755 pairs of headphones, and below are our recommendations for the best wired options. If you're looking for our top picks for more specific types of wired headphones, check out our choices for the best audiophile headphones, the best headphones for studio use, and the best DJ headphones.The best wired headphones we've tested are the Sennheiser HD 800 S. These top-of-the-line audiophile headphones are for people looking for the best. Their high price point already puts them out of reach of most people, and you'll also need a powerful amp to drive them, which is an extra expense if you don't already have one. However, if you're prepared to shell out the money, these well-known headphones create an incredibly spacious and immersive passive soundstage, thanks to their open-back enclosure.They're also very comfortable, ensuring you don't feel fatigued while wearing them for studio sessions. They have a well-balanced sound profile with a very neutral mid-range, ensuring accurate vocals and lead instruments. Although they lack low-bass, this is normal for open-back headphones, and overall, they still have some warmth to their sound, thanks to a small bump in their high-bass. As open-back headphones, they bleed audio by design, so it's best to use them in a quiet room.If you're looking for high-end headphones that can reproduce more bass, try the HiFiMan Arya. These over-ears have planar magnetic drivers, which help improve their bass reproduction. As a result, they have better low-frequency extension and deliver more thump and punch. However, the HiFiMan aren't as well-built, and their soundstage is less natural-sounding, although it's still quite excellent.See our reviewIf you're looking for a premium pair of headphones but want to keep the price under $1,000 without completely sacrificing performance, the HiFiMan Edition XS are a good choice. Unlike the Sennheiser HD 800 S, these headphones have planar magnetic drivers instead of dynamic drivers, which helps them reproduce more bass despite their open-back design. However, their lower price means a compromise in build quality, as they have plastic hinges that don't feel durable.Their padded headband also feels heavy compared to the ski-band headband styles found on other over-ears from this manufacturer, and the headphones can feel quite large if you have a small head. They're still well-built overall and have a comfortable fit for most people. They have a versatile sound profile that clearly reproduces vocals and instruments.Although a dip in their high-mid weakens vocals and instruments, their sound is still present and detailed. Sibilants like hi-hats are also bright without being piercing. They deliver audio consistently, so you don't need to worry much about getting a different sound from use to use. Their open-backed design helps create an open, spacious, and natural passive soundstage, which helps make your audio more immersive.See our reviewThe HiFiMan Sundara 2020 are a more affordable alternative to the pricy HiFiMan Edition XS. You can still expect planar magnetic drivers and a solid sound from these cans, although there are some slight differences. They have a ski-band headband design, which helps distribute the weight of the headphones on your head and ensures a more comfortable fit for long listening sessions. Their ear cups also have a smaller, more circular shape, which looks and feels less bulky than their more expensive counterpart. Although they clamp more tightly onto your head, it's not fatiguing or painful.They have a neutral sound profile with a flat mid-range, so vocals and instruments sound clear, natural, and accurate. However, they lack more thump, rumble, and punch than the Edition XS. While their passive soundstage seems wide, spacious, and open, the headphones struggle to create an out-of-head audio experience, though it's still quite great overall.See our reviewThe Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO are the best mid-range wired headphones we've tested. Unlike the previous picks, they have a closed-back design and are among the best headphones of this type we've tested. These headphones usually have a cheaper price point than their open-back counterparts and are worth checking out if you want a pair of headphones that can block out some background noise and don't leak as much audio.However, the Beyerdynamic also produce a less spacious-seeming, immersive passive soundstage than open-backs like the HiFiMan Sundara 2020. They do a better job of reproducing the thump and rumble of low bass compared to the previous open-back picks. They also have a well-balanced, accurate mid-range response, with instruments and lead vocals that sound present and detailed.However, they have a slightly bright sound profile that makes elements like cymbals or S and T sounds seem piercing. Their audio delivery is inconsistent, so people wearing glasses or having thick hair might notice a drop in bass. If you're looking for a less analytical sound, the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x have a more recessed treble range, so sibilants are dull rather than harsh. They have a warmer overall sound, but their soundstage doesn't feel as natural.See our reviewThe Philips SHP9500 are the best wired over-ear headphones we've tested at the budget level. Unfortunately, they're no longer available through the manufacturer, but you can still easily find them via retailers like Amazon. If you can get a hold of them, they offer a robust audiophile experience. Expect a more plasticky design, as build materials tend to be sacrificed to save money. Although their swiveling ear cups feel prone to breakage over time, they still have a very comfortable fit, meaning you won't feel fatigued during long listening sessions.They have an open-back design to create a wide, spacious-seeming passive soundstage that helps make your audio feel more immersive. They deliver sound consistently and come with a 1/8" to 1/4" adapter, meaning you can connect them to a mixer or amp out of the box. Like most open-back headphones, they have a very neutral sound profile with a very accurate mid-range response, ensuring vocals and lead instruments reproduce accurately. Their treble response is flat but overemphasized, bringing out details and adding brightness to mixes.However, they're lighter on bass than the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO and lack a lot of thump and kick. If you're looking for affordable headphones with a bit more oomph in the lower frequencies, consider the Sony MDR-7506. They're closed-back headphones, so their soundstage isn't as wide or spacious as the Philips, but they have a more extended bass, ensuring ample rumble.See our reviewFor those on a shoestring budget, the best cheap wired headphones we've tested are the Superlux HD 681. You'll have to make larger sacrifices to save money at this price point. Their build is mostly low-grade plastic, the audio cable isn't detachable, and overall, they seem less premium and durable than the Philips SHP9500. However, they're still worth checking out, especially as they have a semi-open design, unlike our previous picks. It helps them create an open and spacious soundstage, making your listening experience more immersive. It also has the added benefit of blocking background noise and reducing audio bleed.These over-ear headphones are lightweight and have a very comfortable fit. They also have a very neutral sound profile suitable for various genres and types of content. Their bass response is slightly overemphasized across the range, adding some extra rumble, punch, and boom to mixes, but instruments and lead vocals are present and detailed. They have fairly consistent bass and treble delivery, but you may notice a drop in bass if you have thick hair or wear glasses.See our reviewThe MOONDROP Blessing 3 are the best wired earbuds we've tested. These premium in-ear monitors (IEMs) are designed for good sound quality and offer some versatility over the over-ears listed here since you can buy a cable with a mic if you want to make phone calls. They have a hybrid driver design, including dynamic drivers and four armature drivers for the mid and treble ranges. It helps them accurately reproduce higher frequencies, ensuring a natural and detailed sound.Their bass response is also very neutral, so your audio's rumble, punch, and boom are reproduced accurately. They have a very sturdy design, and the audio cable is detachable, so it's less likely to break if it snags on something. They have a comfortable fit for most people. The cables loop around your ears, which helps prevent them from falling out even if you move your head around a lot. They don't have ANC, which is normal for IEMs, but still passively block out an impressive amount of mid-range noise, like background conversations.All that said, they aren't cheap and won't be for everyone. If you're looking for less expensive wired in-ears, the MOONDROP Aria are a much more budget-friendly option from the same brand. These in-ears aren't as well-built, block out much less noise, and only use dynamic drivers. While both models have fairly neutral mids, the Aria's treble is more recessed, so sibilants like cymbals are weak.See our review  Oct 18, 2023:                 Verified that the picks represent the best recommendations in each category and made small changes to keep the text current.

Jul 06, 2023:                 Replaced the MOONDROP Aria with the MOONDROP Blessing 3 because of their more premium build and neutral sound profile.               Our recommendations above are what we think are currently the best wired over-ears to buy for most people depending on their needs. We factor in the price (cheaper headphones win over pricier ones if the difference isn't worth it), feedback from our visitors, and availability (no headphones that are difficult to find or almost out of stock everywhere).If you would like to choose for yourself, here is the list of all our reviews for wired headphones. Be careful not to get caught up in the details. There are no perfect headphones. Personal taste, preference, and listening habits will matter more in your selection.A good headset can make a big difference when playing games. Whether you like to get immersed in the game with the music or sound effects or need to hear every enemy footstep, choosing the right headphones for you can be quite a task. You should look at overall build quality, how comfortable they are, how they sound, and if the microphone sounds good. Most wired audiophile headphones will be a good option if you don't need a microphone.We've tested over 755 headphones, and below are our recommendations for the best headsets to buy for gaming. Also, see our recommendations for the best PS4 headsets, the best Xbox One headsets, the best PS5 headsets, and the best Xbox Series X/S headsets.The best headset for gaming we've tested is the Audeze Maxwell Wireless. These sturdy, feature-packed wireless headphones come in Xbox and PlayStation variants compatible with PCs. They stand out from many other gaming headsets because they use planar magnetic drivers, which helps them produce a more extended bass response and create a wider passive soundstage relative to dynamic driver headphones like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro.Their default sound profile is neutral, so elements like footsteps, explosions, and voices in cutscenes are reproduced accurately. You can also use their app's EQ presets for sound customization. These headphones support Dolby Atmos, a virtual surround sound feature to make your listening experience more immersive. They come with a USB dongle with a low-latency connection, so your audio and video will stay in sync while gaming. You have plenty of options for connecting to your console or PC.The Audeze also support multi-device pairing, so you can hear audio from your phone via Bluetooth and your console simultaneously, as long as you use an analog or wired USB connection. For online gamers, the detachable boom mic offers great performance. It makes your voice sound clear and understandable, and the mic has outstanding noise handling, so it won't be drowned out by noise in the background. However, these headphones are back-ordered, so getting a pair can take a while.See our reviewThe Logitech G PRO X 2 LIGHTSPEED Wireless is the best gaming headset we've tested at this price point. Unlike the Audeze Maxwell Wireless, these comfortable cans don't come in console-specific variants. They have wireless support on PCs and PlayStation consoles, but you can only use them via analog on Xbox. On the upside, they support Bluetooth, so you can connect them to your Nintendo Switch.Their bass-heavy sound makes gameplay feel more exciting without drowning out vocals. You can't transfer over EQ settings from their companion app to consoles like the PS5, though. Their 97-hour battery life can easily handle many days' worth of gaming before needing a recharge, while their dongle ensures that your audio and visuals stay in sync. If you like to game with others, their detachable boom mic also separates your voice from background noise very well, so speech is heard clearly.Unfortunately, the recording quality is just okay, and your voice sounds unnatural to whoever's on the other end of the line. If you're looking for headphones with better recording quality, try the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro. The boom mic on these wired-only cans captures clear and natural-sounding speech. They even come with a GameDAC that puts controls like EQ and channel mixing at your fingertips. However, they aren't as comfortable or well-built as the Logitech.See our reviewThe SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Wireless are the best headphones for gaming in the mid-range we've tested. Their wireless USB dongle provides low enough latency for gaming, so your audio and video won't be out of sync. Similar to the previous picks, they have a bass-rich sound profile with a well-balanced mid-range, so voices are present and clear but can also sound veiled and lack detail. Fortunately, the app features a graphic EQ and presets for sound customization.While they don't last as long continuously as the Logitech G PRO X 2 LIGHTSPEED Wireless, their roughly 30-hour battery life will still get you through long dungeon crawls. You can also use them wired in a pinch. They have a high noise floor while monitoring your voice, and while that's a downside if you play a lot of multiplayer games, the mic still makes your voice sound clear and natural.These headphones also support Bluetooth, which allows you to mix chat audio or music from your phone and game audio. They also come in a few variants for different consoles. We tested the 7X variant, which is meant for Xbox but can also connect with PlayStation using the USB dongle, although any changes you made in the app, like sound customizations, won't apply. The 7 and 7P variants don't support a wireless connection with Xbox but might be the better choice if you only use a PC or PlayStation.See our reviewIf you're looking for a budget-friendly headset for gaming, check out the Logitech G535 LIGHTSPEED Wireless. These inexpensive headphones are missing some of the previous picks' helpful features, like Bluetooth, a wired connection, and Xbox compatibility. However, if you're a PlayStation gamer or looking for the best PC gaming headset in the budget range, they're worth a look, thanks to their wireless dongle that provides a low latency connection for gaming.Their default sound lacks low-bass, so your audio is missing some thump and rumble. There's some overemphasis in the high-bass range that adds warmth and punch, which can help bring out sound effects like footsteps in games. They work with companion software that includes a graphic EQ with sound presets and virtual surround sound features that can help create a more immersive listening experience. However, if you use the mic often when gaming, remember that it doesn't have the best performance and makes your voice sound thin compared to the pricier headphones here.See our reviewThe best budget gaming headset we've tested is the Logitech G432. A reputable brand like Logitech can be a safe bet if you care about quality and durability, as lower-priced models on the market can have glaring flaws like driver mismatches and faulty frames. Unlike the Logitech G535 LIGHTSPEED Wireless, the G432 are wired-only but still offer a solid performance rivaling more expensive wireless models. These headphones also have a good mic performance, so your voice is easily understood when gaming with friends. Their lightweight, comfortable fit is suitable for long gaming sessions as well.Their sound profile is light on bass, which isn't ideal for action-packed games, but you can customize it with a graphic EQ and presets in the companion app. Their wired USΒ dongle provides a low latency connection and works with PlayStation consoles, but it's incompatible with Xbox. You can still use the headphones with these consoles if you plug them into a controller, but it'll mean you can't use applied changes made in the EQ via the companion app.See our reviewThe best cheap gaming headset we've tested is the Logitech G435 LIGHTSPEED Wireless. Logitech manufactures a solid lineup of low-cost gaming headphones that perform very well. In the case of the G435, their plastic frame isn't the sturdiest, but they have decently low latency over both Bluetooth and their wireless USB dongle. They also have a slightly warm sound profile with extra bass to make explosions and footsteps more prominent in the mix. Dialogue and instruments also sound bright and present, but you can't adjust their sound to your preferences since they don't have an EQ.They also have poor passive noise isolation performance and will let in a lot of noise and leak a lot of game audio to those around you. Fortunately, their mic makes your voice sound bright and clear, though a little unnatural, and their nearly 20-hour battery will last you through several play sessions. While these features make this the best PC gaming headset and the best for PlayStation consoles we've tested at this price range, this model sadly isn't compatible with Xbox consoles.See our reviewThe best open-back gaming headset we've tested is the Drop + Sennheiser/EPOS PC38X. These wired headphones are around the same price as the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Wireless, but you might prefer them if you like your game audio to be as immersive as possible. Their open design helps them create a soundstage that seems wider and more spacious than the closed-back options on this list. While they lack a bit of low-bass, they have a well-balanced sound profile suitable for action-packed games or dialogue-heavy cutscenes. However, they aren't ideal for use in a noisy or shared space since they don't block out ambient sound and leak a lot of audio by design.They're well-built and comfortable to wear, with a choice of either microfiber or velour ear cup padding. They also have a boom mic that makes your voice sound natural and full-bodied during multiplayer games. Because of their wired design, they work with most consoles, and you don't need to worry about latency. Their onboard controls are limited; you can flip up the mic to mute it and adjust the volume with a wheel on one ear cup.See our review  Oct 26, 2023:                 Added the Razer BlackShark V2 HyperSpeed Wireless to the Notable Mentions.
